lactate/malate dehydrogenase, NAD binding domain
L-lactate dehydrogenases are metabolic enzymes which catalyse the conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate, the last step in anaerobic glycolysis. L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenases are also members of the family.  Malate dehydrogenases catalyse the interconversion of malate to oxaloacetate. The enzyme participates in the citric acid cycle. L-lactate dehydrogenase is also found as a lens crystallin in bird and crocodile eyes. N-terminus (this family) is a Rossmann NAD-binding fold. C-terminus is an unusual alpha+beta fold.
