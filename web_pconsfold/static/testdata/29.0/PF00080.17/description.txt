Sod_Cu
Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SODC)
superoxide dismutases (SODs) catalyse the conversion of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen.  Three evolutionarily distinct families of SODs are known, of which the copper/zinc-binding  family is one. Defects in the human SOD1 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). Structure is an eight-stranded beta sandwich, similar to the immunoglobulin fold.
