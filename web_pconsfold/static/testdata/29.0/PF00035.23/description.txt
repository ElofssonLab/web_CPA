dsrm
Double-stranded RNA binding motif
Sequences gathered for seed by HMM_iterative_training Putative motif shared by proteins that bind to dsRNA. At least some DSRM proteins seem to bind to specific RNA targets. Exemplified by Staufen, which is involved in localisation of at least five different mRNAs in the early Drosophila embryo. Also by interferon-induced protein kinase in humans, which is part of the cellular response to dsRNA.
