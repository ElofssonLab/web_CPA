Toxin_TOLIP
Snake toxin and toxin-like protein
This family predominantly includes venomous neurotoxins and  cytotoxins from snakes, but also structurally similar (non-snake) toxin-like proteins (TOLIPs) such as Lymphocyte antigen 6D and  Ly6/PLAUR domain-containing protein. Snake toxins are short  proteins with a compact, disulphide-rich structure. TOLIPs have  similar structural features (abundance of spaced cysteine residues,  a high frequency of charge residues, a signal peptide for secretion  and a compact structure) but, are not associated with a venom  gland or poisonous function. They are endogenous animal proteins  that are not restricted to poisonous animals [1].
