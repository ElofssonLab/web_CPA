Asp
Eukaryotic aspartyl protease
Aspartyl (acid) proteases include pepsins, cathepsins, and renins.  Two-domain structure, probably arising from ancestral duplication.  This family does not include the retroviral nor retrotransposon proteases (Pfam:PF00077), which are much smaller and appear to be homologous to a single domain of the eukaryotic asp proteases.
