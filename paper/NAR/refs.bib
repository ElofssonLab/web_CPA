have provided valuable information about protein domain distribution
in the kingdoms of life. Earlier studies have been limited by
the fact that only about 50\% of the proteomes could be matched
to a domain. Here, we have extended these studies by including
less well-defined domain definitions, Pfam-B and clustered domains,
MAS, in addition to Pfam-A and SCOP domains. It was found that
a significant fraction of these domain families are homologous
to Pfam-A or SCOP domains. Further, we show that all regions that
do not match a Pfam-A or SCOP domain contain a significantly higher
fraction of disordered structure. These unstructured regions may
be contained within orphan domains or function as linkers between
structured domains. Using several different definitions we have
re-estimated the number of multi-domain proteins in different
organisms and found that several methods all predict that eukaryotes
have approximately 65\% multi-domain proteins, while the prokaryotes
consist of approximately 40\% multi-domain proteins. However,
these numbers are strongly dependent on the exact choice of cut-off
for domains in unassigned regions. In conclusion, all eukaryotes
have similar fractions of multi-domain proteins and disorder,
whereas  a high fraction of repeating domain is distinguished
only in multicellular eukaryotes. This implies a role for repeats
in cell-cell contacts while the other two features are important
for intracellular functions.}

from fusions  of genes, deletions and internal repetitions. An
investigation of such evolutionary events requires a method to
find the domain architecture from which  each protein originates.
Therefore, we defined a novel measure, domain distance,  which
is calculated as the number of domains that differ between two
domain architectures. Using this measure the evolutionary events
that distinguish a protein from its closest ancestor have been
studied and it was found that indels  are more common than internal
repetition and that the exchange of a domain is rare. Indels and
repetitions are common at both the N and C-terminals while they
are rare between domains. The evolution of the majority of multi-domain
proteins  can be explained by the stepwise insertions of single
domains, with the exception of repeats that sometimes are duplicated
several domains in tandem. We show that  domain distances agree
with sequence similarity and semantic similarity based on  gene
ontology annotations. In addition, we demonstrate the use of the
domain distance measure to build evolutionary trees. Finally,
the evolution of multi-domain proteins is exemplified by a closer
study of the evolution of two protein families, non-receptor tyrosine
kinases and RhoGEFs.}

central importance in a wide variety of vital cellular functions.
Despite considerable effort on methods to predict the location
of the helices, little attention has been directed toward developing
an automatic method to pack the helices together. In principle,
the prediction of membrane proteins should be easier than the
prediction of globular proteins: there is only one type of secondary
structure and all helices pack with a common alignment across
the membrane. This allows all possible structures to be represented
on a simple lattice and exhaustively enumerated. Prediction success
lies not in generating many possible folds but in recognizing
which corresponds to the native. Our evaluation of each fold is
based on how well the exposed surface predicted from a multiple
sequence alignment fits its allocated position. Just as exposure
to solvent in globular proteins can be predicted from sequence
variation, so exposure to lipid can be recognized by variable-hydrophobic
(variphobic) positions. Application to both bacteriorhodopsin
and the eukaryotic rhodopsin/opsin families revealed that the
angular size of the lipid-exposed faces must be predicted accurately
to allow selection of the correct fold. With the inherent uncertainties
in helix prediction and parameter choice, this accuracy could
not be guaranteed but the correct fold was typically found in
the top six candidates. Our method provides the first completely
automatic method that can proceed from a scan of the protein sequence
databanks to a predicted three-dimensional structure with no intervention
required from the investigator. Within the limited domain of the
seven helix bundle proteins, a good chance can be given of selecting
the correct structure. However, the limited number of sequences
available with a corresponding known structure makes further characterization
of the method difficult.}

to 14 transmembrane (TM) segments and has a single endogenous
site of N-glycosylation at Asn642 in extracellular (EC) loop 4.
The requirements for N-glycosylation of EC loops and the topology
of this polytopic membrane protein were determined by scanning
N-glycosylation mutagenesis and cell-free translation in a reticulocyte
lysate supplemented with microsomal membranes. The endogenous
and novel acceptor sites located near the middle of the 35 residue
EC loop 4 were efficiently N-glycosylated; however, no N-glycosylation
occurred at sites located within sharply defined regions close
to the adjacent TM segments. Acceptor sites located in the center
of EC loop 3, which contains 25 residues, were poorly N-glycosylated.
Expansion of this loop with a 4-residue insert containing an acceptor
site increased N-glycosylation. Acceptor sites located in short
(<10 residues) loops (putative EC loops 1, 2, 6, and 7) were not
N-glycosylated; however, insertion of EC loop 4 into EC loops
1, 2, or 7, but not 6, resulted in efficient N-glycosylation.
Acceptor sites in putative intracellular (IC) loop 5 exhibited
a similar pattern of N-glycosylation as EC loop 4, indicating
a lumenal disposition during biosynthesis. To be efficiently N-glycosylated,
EC loops in polytopic membrane proteins must be larger than 25
residues in size, with acceptor sites located greater than 12
residues away from the preceding TM segment and greater than 14
residues away from the following TM segment. Application of this
requirement allowed a significant refinement of the topology of
Band 3 including a more accurate mapping of the ends of TM segments.
The strict distance dependence for N-glycosylation of loops suggests
that TM segments in polytopic membrane proteins are held quite
precisely within the translocation machinery during the N-glycosylation
process.}

Progress toward this objective is summarized in this review by
means of a thermodynamic framework for describing membrane protein
folding and stability. The framework includes a coherent thermodynamic
formalism for determining and describing the energetics of peptide-bilayer
interactions and a review of the properties of the environment
of membrane proteins--the bilayer milieu. Using a four-step thermodynamic
cycle as a guide, advances in three main aspects of membrane protein
folding energetics are discussed: protein binding and folding
in bilayer interfaces, transmembrane helix insertion, and helix-helix
interactions. The concepts of membrane protein stability that
emerge provide insights to fundamental issues of protein folding.}

useful in the context of analyzing entire proteomes, as well as
in everyday sequence analysis. Here, we analyzed 27 advanced and
simple methods in detail. To resolve contradictions in previous
works and to reevaluate transmembrane helix prediction algorithms,
we introduced an analysis that distinguished between performance
on redundancy-reduced high- and low-resolution data sets, established
thresholds for significant differences in performance, and implemented
both per-segment and per-residue analysis of membrane helix predictions.
Although some of the advanced methods performed better than others,
we showed in a thorough bootstrapping experiment based on various
measures of accuracy that no method performed consistently best.
In contrast, most simple hydrophobicity scale-based methods were
significantly less accurate than any advanced method as they overpredicted
membrane helices and confused membrane helices with hydrophobic
regions outside of membranes. In contrast, the advanced methods
usually distinguished correctly between membrane-helical and other
proteins. Nonetheless, few methods reliably distinguished between
signal peptides and membrane helices. We could not verify a significant
difference in performance between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins.
Surprisingly, we found that proteins with more than five helices
were predicted at a significantly lower accuracy than proteins
with five or fewer. The important implication is that structurally
unsolved multispanning membrane proteins, which are often important
drug targets, will remain problematic for transmembrane helix
prediction algorithms. Overall, by establishing a standardized
methodology for transmembrane helix prediction evaluation, we
have resolved differences among previous works and presented novel
trends that may impact the analysis of entire proteomes.}

At the bottom of the basin are three independent binding sites,

The basis of the method is the addition of a membrane potential

prediction of tertiary structure of globular proteins (FRAGFOLD).
The method is based on the assembly of supersecondary structural
fragments taken from a library of highly resolved protein structures
using a standard simulated annealing algorithm. The membrane potential
has been derived by the statistical analysis of a data set made
of 640 transmembrane helices with experimentally defined topology
and belonging to 133 proteins extracted from the SWISS-PROT database.
Results obtained by applying the method to small membrane proteins
of known 3D structure show that the method is able to predict,
at a reasonable accuracy level, both the helix topology and the
conformations of these proteins.}

method for prediction of helical transmembrane protein structures.
The membrane environment is modeled by embedding the protein chain
into a model membrane represented by parallel planes defining
hydrophobic, interface, and polar membrane layers for each energy
evaluation. The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing
the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane
and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein
conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly
method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of
the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue
and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane
layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density.
We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are
achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain,
which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after
translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously
as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method. In tests
on 12 membrane proteins for which the structure is known, between
51 and 145 residues were predicted with root-mean-square deviation
<4 A from the native structure.}

of earlier HMM methods. In our tests, PRODIV-TMHMM outperforms
earlier methods both when evaluated on "low-resolution" topology
data and on high-resolution 3D structures. The results presented
here indicate that the topology could be correctly predicted for
approximately two-thirds of all membrane proteins using PRODIV-TMHMM.
The importance of evolutionary information for topology prediction
is emphasized by the fact that compared with using single sequences,
the performance of PRODIV-TMHMM (as well as two other methods)
is increased by approximately 10 percentage units by the use of
homologous sequences. On a more general level, we also show that
HMM-based (or similar) methods perform superiorly to methods that
focus mainly on identification of the membrane regions.}

region. Here, we show that this region is enriched in irregular
structure and in interfacial helices running roughly parallel
with the membrane surface, while beta-strands are extremely rare.
The average amino acid composition is different between the interfacial
helices, the parts of the transmembrane helices located in the
interface region, and the irregular structures. In this region,
hydrophobic and aromatic residues tend to point toward the membrane
and charged/polar residues tend to point away from the membrane.
The interface region thus imposes different constraints on protein
structure than do the central hydrocarbon core of the membrane
and the surrounding aqueous phase.}

From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical

information about protein association is scattered over a wide
variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify
access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled
collection of protein-protein associations for a large number
of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput
experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature,
and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING
integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against
a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent
and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are
extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described,
by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms,
where applicable. STRING currently holds 730,000 proteins in 180
fully sequenced organisms, and is available at \verb+http://string.embl.de/.+}

genes, comprise the largest family of integral membrane proteins
and act as cell surface receptors responsible for the transduction
of endogenous signal into a cellular response. Although tertiary
structural information is crucial for function annotation and
drug design, there are few experimentally determined GPCR structures.
To address this issue, we employ the recently developed threading
assembly refinement (TASSER) method to generate structure predictions
for all 907 putative GPCRs in the human genome. Unlike traditional
homology modeling approaches, TASSER modeling does not require
solved homologous template structures; moreover, it often refines
the structures closer to native. These features are essential
for the comprehensive modeling of all human GPCRs when close homologous
templates are absent. Based on a benchmarked confidence score,
approximately 820 predicted models should have the correct folds.
The majority of GPCR models share the characteristic seven-transmembrane
helix topology, but 45 ORFs are predicted to have different structures.
This is due to GPCR fragments that are predominantly from extracellular
or intracellular domains as well as database annotation errors.
Our preliminary validation includes the automated modeling of
bovine rhodopsin, the only solved GPCR in the Protein Data Bank.
With homologous templates excluded, the final model built by TASSER
has a global C(alpha) root-mean-squared deviation from native
of 4.6 A, with a root-mean-squared deviation in the transmembrane
helix region of 2.1 A. Models of several representative GPCRs
are compared with mutagenesis and affinity labeling data, and
consistent agreement is demonstrated. Structure clustering of
the predicted models shows that GPCRs with similar structures
tend to belong to a similar functional class even when their sequences
are diverse. These results demonstrate the usefulness and robustness
of the in silico models for GPCR functional analysis. All predicted
GPCR models are freely available for noncommercial users on our

sequence similarities are statistically insignificant, unless
compared among proteins that recognize identical or very similar
sequences. Bsp6I is a Type II REase, which recognizes the palindromic
DNA sequence 5'GCNGC and cleaves between the cytosine and the
unspecified nucleotide in both strands, generating a double-strand
break with 5'-protruding single nucleotides. There are no solved
structures of REases that recognize similar DNA targets or generate
cleavage products with similar characteristics. In straightforward
comparisons, the Bsp6I sequence shows no significant similarity
to REases with known structures. However, using a fold-recognition
approach, we have identified a remote relationship between Bsp6I
and the structure of PvuII. Starting from the sequence-structure
alignment between Bsp6I and PvuII, we constructed a homology model
of Bsp6I and used it to predict functionally significant regions
in Bsp6I. The homology model was supported by site-directed mutagenesis
of residues predicted to be important for dimerization, DNA binding
and catalysis. Completing the picture of sequence-structure-function
relationships in protein superfamilies becomes an essential task
in the age of structural genomics and our study may serve as a
paradigm for future analyses of superfamilies comprising strongly

Many repeats appear to possess high amino acid substitution rates

Even if the presence of a certain repeat family is known, the
exact locations and the number of repetitive units often cannot
be determined using current methods. We have devised an iterative
algorithm based on optimal and sub-optimal score distributions
from profile analysis that estimates the significance of all repeats
that are detected in a single sequence. This procedure allows
the identification of homologues at alignment scores lower than
the highest optimal alignment score for non-homologous sequences.
The method has been used to investigate the occurrence of eleven
families of repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis
elegans and Homo sapiens accounting for 1055, 2205 and 2320 repeats,
respectively. For these examples, the method is both more sensitive
and more selective than conventional homology search procedures.
The method allowed the detection in the SwissProt database of
more than 2000 previously unrecognised repeats belonging to the
11 families. In addition, the method was used to merge several
repeat families that previously were supposed to be distinct,
indicating common phylogenetic origins for these families.}

binding surface area. Constraints on sequence conservation appear
to be relatively lax, due to binding functions ensuing from multiple,

detection can be a particularly arduous task. We also consider
the conundrum of how multiple repeats, which show strong structural
and functional interdependencies, ever evolved from a single repeat
ancestor. In this review, we illustrate each of these points by
referring to six prolific repeat types (repeats in beta-propellers

with diverse recognitional specificities are found within a single

gene duplication, followed by DNA-sequence divergence by point
mutation, and by deletion and duplication of intragenic DNA repeats
encoding blocks of leucine-rich elements. Recombination between
related genes reassorts this variation to further diversify gene
sequences. Pathogen pressure selects functional resistance specificities

data reveal that the NBS-LRR (i.e. nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich
repeat) class of R genes represents as much as 1\% of the Arabidopsis
genome. Experimental data have shown that the LRR has a role in
determination of specificity. Mutation experiments, in which R-gene

box (KRAB). Depending on the structure of the KRAB domain, these
proteins have been further divided into three subfamilies (A +
B, A + b, and A only). In addition, some KRAB zinc finger proteins
contain another conserved motif called SCAN. To study their molecular
evolution, an extensive comparative analysis of a large panel
of KRAB zinc finger genes was performed. The results show that
both the KRAB A + b and the KRAB A subfamilies have their origin
in a single member or a few closely related members of the KRAB
A + B family. The KRAB A + B family is also the most prevalent
among the KRAB zinc finger genes. Furthermore, we show that internal
duplications of individual zinc finger motifs or blocks of several
zinc finger motifs have occurred quite frequently within this
gene family. However, zinc finger motifs are also frequently lost
from the open reading frame, either by functional inactivation
by point mutations or by the introduction of a stop codon. The
introduction of a stop codon causes the exclusion of part of the
zinc finger region from the coding region and the formation of
graveyards of degenerate zinc finger motifs in the 3'-untranslated
region of these genes. Earlier reports have shown that duplications
of zinc finger genes commonly occur throughout evolution. We show
that there is a relatively low degree of sequence conservation
of the zinc finger motifs after these duplications. In many cases
this may cause altered binding specificities of the transcription
factors encoded by these genes. The repetitive nature of the zinc
finger region and the structural flexibility within the zinc finger
motif make these proteins highly adaptable. These factors may
have been of major importance for their massive expansion in both
number and complexity during metazoan evolution.}

instances where metrics, such as GDT_TS, ranked what we considered
incorrect predictions highly. We found the quality of the best
predictions to be very good: for nearly every target at least
one group predicted a structure close to the correct one. However,
selection of the best of five models is still problematic. The
group of David Baker once again proved to be best overall, with
many individual highlights. However, high quality and consistency
were also seen from others, suggesting that the community is moving
toward general procedures to predict accurate structures for proteins
showing no resemblance to anything seen before. Predictions for
secondary structure showed at best limited progress since CASP4.
The number of targets is probably too small to spot differences
in performance between methods, suggesting that such predictions
might be better evaluated with schemes involving more proteins.
For contact predictions, accuracies are still low, although there

of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates.
From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical
binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation
in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently,
information about protein association is scattered over a wide
variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify
access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled
collection of protein-protein associations for a large number
of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput
experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature,
and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING
integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against
a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent
and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are
extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described,
by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms,
where applicable. STRING currently holds 730,000 proteins in 180
fully sequenced organisms, and is available at \verb+http://string.embl.de/.+}

	abstract = {Many proteins, especially in eukaryotes, contain tandem repeats
of several domains from the same family. These repeats have a
variety of binding properties  and are involved in protein-protein
interactions as well as binding to other ligands such as DNA and
RNA. The rapid expansion of protein domain repeats is assumed
to have evolved through internal tandem duplications. However,
the exact  mechanisms behind these tandem duplications are not
well-understood. Here, we have studied the evolution, function,
protein structure, gene structure, and phylogenetic distribution
of domain repeats. For this purpose we have assigned Pfam-A domain
families to 24 proteomes with more sensitive domain assignments
in  the repeat regions. These assignments confirmed previous findings
that eukaryotes, and in particular vertebrates, contain a much
higher fraction of proteins with repeats compared with prokaryotes.
The internal sequence similarity in each protein revealed that
the domain repeats are often expanded through duplications of
several domains at a time, while the duplication of one domain
is less common. Many of the repeats appear to have been duplicated
in the middle of  the repeat region. This is in strong contrast
to the evolution of other proteins  that mainly works through
additions of single domains at either terminus. Further, we found
that some domain families show distinct duplication patterns,
e.g., nebulin domains have mainly been expanded with a unit of
seven domains at a time, while duplications of other domain families
involve varying numbers of domains. Finally, no common mechanism
for the expansion of all repeats could be detected. We found that
the duplication patterns show no dependence on the size of the
domains. Further, repeat expansion in some families can possibly
be explained by shuffling of exons. However, exon shuffling could
not have created all repeats.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein families can be defined based on structure
or sequence similarity. We wanted to compare two protein family
databases, one based on structural and one on sequence similarity,
to investigate to what extent they overlap, the similarity in
definition of corresponding families, and to create a  list of
large protein families with unknown structure as a resource for
structural genomics. We also wanted to increase the sensitivity
of fold assignment by exploiting protein family HMMs. RESULTS:
We compared Pfam, a protein family database based on sequence
similarity, to Scop, which is based on  structural similarity.
We found that 70\% of the Scop families exist in Pfam while 57\%
of the Pfam families exist in Scop. Most families that occur in
both databases correspond well to each other, but in some cases
they are different. Such cases highlight situations in which structure
and sequence approaches differ significantly. The comparison enabled
us to compile a list of the largest families that do not occur
in Scop; these are suitable targets for structure prediction and
determination, and may be useful to guide projects in structural
genomics. It can be noted that 13 out of the 20 largest protein
families without  a known structure are likely transmembrane proteins.
We also exploited Pfam to increase the sensitivity of detecting
homologs of proteins with known structure,  by comparing query
sequences to Pfam HMMs that correspond to Scop families. For SWISSPROT+TREMBL,
this yielded an increase in fold assignment from 31\% to 42\%
compared to using FASTA only. This method assigned a structure
to 22\% of the proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 24\% in Escherichia
coli, and 16\% in Methanococcus jannaschii.}

The Alternative Splicing Database consortium has been addressing

regulatory mechanisms that mediate splice variants. In this paper
we present two of the products from this project: namely, a database
of computationally delineated alternative splice events as seen
in alignments of EST/cDNA sequences with genome sequences, and
a database of alternatively spliced exons collected from literature.
The reported splice events are from nine different organisms and
are annotated for various biological features including expression
states and cross-species conservation. The data are presented
on our ASD web pages (\verb+http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd).+}

insight into protein function, and many cellular processes are
performed by stable protein complexes. We used tandem affinity
purification to process 4,562 different tagged proteins of the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each preparation was analysed
by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight
mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
to increase coverage and accuracy. Machine learning was used to
integrate the mass spectrometry scores and assign probabilities
to the protein-protein interactions. Among 4,087 different proteins
identified with high confidence by mass spectrometry from 2,357
successful purifications, our core data set (median precision
of 0.69) comprises 7,123 protein-protein interactions involving
2,708 proteins. A Markov clustering algorithm organized these
interactions into 547 protein complexes averaging 4.9 subunits
per complex, about half of them absent from the MIPS database,
as well as 429 additional interactions between pairs of complexes.
The data (all of which are available online) will help future
studies on individual proteins as well as functional genomics
and systems biology.}

Knowing which proteins are assembled in these complexes is therefore
essential to understanding protein function(s). Unfortunately,
recent high throughput protein interaction studies have failed
to deliver any significant information on proteins embedded in
the membrane, and many membrane protein complexes remain ill defined.
In this study, we have optimized the blue native-PAGE technique
for the study of membrane protein complexes in the inner and outer
membranes of Escherichia coli. In combination with second dimension
SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, we have been able to identify
43 distinct protein complexes. In addition to a number of well
characterized complexes, we have identified known and orphan proteins
in novel oligomeric states. For two orphan proteins, YhcB and
YjdB, our findings enable a tentative functional assignment. We
propose that YhcB is a hitherto unidentified additional subunit
of the cytochrome bd oxidase and that YjdB, which co-localizes
with the ZipA protein, is involved in cell division. Our reference
two-dimensional blue native-SDS-polyacrylamide gels will facilitate
future studies of the assembly and composition of E. coli membrane
protein complexes during different growth conditions and in different
mutant backgrounds.}

current experimental techniques for large-scale detection of protein-protein

protein-protein interaction broadly as co-complexation, and develop
a weighted-voting procedure to predict interactions among yeast
helical membrane proteins by optimally combining evidence based
on diverse genome-wide information such as sequence, function,
localization, abundance, regulation, and phenotype. We use logistic
regression to simultaneously optimize the weights of all evidence
sources for best discrimination based on a set of known helical
membrane protein interactions. The resulting integrated classifier
not only significantly outperforms classifiers based on any single
genomic feature, but also does better than a benchmark Naive Bayes
classifier (using a simplifying assumption of conditional independence
among features). Finally, we apply the optimized classifier genome-wide,
and construct a comprehensive map of predicted helical membrane
protein interactome in yeast. This can serve as a guide for prioritizing
further experimental validation efforts.}

non-redundant) of high-resolution structures of membrane proteins
to evaluate and analyse TM helix prediction. The redundant (non-redundant)
dataset contains structure of 434 (268) TM helices, from 112 (73)
polypeptide chains. Of the 434 helices in the dataset, 20 may
be classified as 'half-TM' as they are too short to span a lipid
bilayer. We compared 13 TM helix prediction methods, evaluating
each method using per segment, per residue and termini scores.
Four methods consistently performed well: SPLIT4, TMHMM2, HMMTOP2
and TMAP. However, even the best methods were in error by, on
average, about two turns of helix at the TM helix termini. The
best and worst case predictions for individual proteins were analysed.
In particular, the performance of the various methods and of a
consensus prediction method, were compared for a number of proteins
(e.g. SecY, ClC, KvAP) containing half-TM helices. The difficulties
of predicting half-TM helices suggests that current prediction
methods successfully embody the two-state model of membrane protein
folding, but do not accommodate a third stage in which, e.g.,
short helices and re-entrant loops fold within a bundle of stable
TM helices.}

other on the basis of the number of transmembrane helices and
sequence similarities. Building on the Pfam classification of
protein domain families, and using transmembrane-helix prediction
and sequence-similarity searching, we identified a total of 526
well-characterized membrane protein families in 26 recently sequenced
genomes. To this we added a clustering of a number of predicted
but unclassified membrane proteins, resulting in a total of 637
membrane protein families. RESULTS: Analysis of the occurrence
and composition of these families revealed several interesting
trends. The number of assigned membrane protein domains has an
approximately linear relationship to the total number of open
reading frames (ORFs) in 26 genomes studied. Caenorhabditis elegans
is an apparent outlier, because of its high representation of
seven-span transmembrane (7-TM) chemoreceptor families. In all
genomes, including that of C. elegans, the number of distinct
membrane protein families has a logarithmic relation to the number
of ORFs. Glycine, proline, and tyrosine locations tend to be conserved
in transmembrane regions within families, whereas isoleucine,
valine, and methionine locations are relatively mutable. Analysis
of motifs in putative transmembrane helices reveals that GxxxG
and GxxxxxxG (which can be written GG4 and GG7, respectively;
see Materials and methods) are among the most prevalent. This
was noted in earlier studies; we now find these motifs are particularly
well conserved in families, however, especially those corresponding
to transporters, symporters, and channels. CONCLUSIONS: We carried
out a genome-wide analysis on patterns of the classified polytopic
membrane protein families and analyzed the distribution of conserved
amino acids and motifs in the transmembrane helix regions in these
families.}

an ancillary role to membrane spanning helices and are analogous
to the surface active helices of peripheral membrane proteins,
being involved in: lipid association, membrane perturbation, transmembrane
signal transduction and regulation, and transmembrane helical
bundle formation. Due to the difficulties in obtaining high-resolution
structural data for this class of proteins, structure-from-sequence
predictive methods continue to be developed as a means to obtain
structural models for these largely intractable systems. A simple
but effective variant of the hydrophobic moment analysis of amino
acid sequences is described here as part of a protocol for distinguishing
helical sequences that are parallel to or 'horizontal' at the
membrane bilayer/aqueous phase interface from helices that are
membrane-embedded or located in extra-membranous domains. This
protocol when tested on transmembrane spanning protein amino acid
sequences not used in its development, was found to be 84-91\%
accurate when the results were compared to the partition locations
in the corresponding structures determined by X-ray crystallography,

We analyzed a divergent set of GPCRs and found distinct loop length

GPCRHMM, a hidden Markov model, to fit those features and trained
it on a large dataset representing the entire superfamily. GPCRHMM
was benchmarked to profile HMMs and generic transmembrane detectors
on sets of known GPCRs and non-GPCRs. In a cross-validation procedure,
profile HMMs produced an error rate nearly twice as high as GPCRHMM.
In a sensitivity-selectivity test, GPCRHMM's sensitivity was about
15\% higher than that of the best transmembrane predictors, at
comparable false positive rates. We used GPCRHMM to search for
novel members of the GPCR superfamily in five proteomes. All in
all we detected 120 sequences that lacked annotation and are potentially
novel GPCRs. Out of those 102 were found in Caenorhabditis elegans,
four in human, and seven in mouse. Many predictions (65) belonged
to Pfam domains of unknown function. GPCRHMM strongly rejected
a family of arthropod-specific odorant receptors believed to be

the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to determine the proteome
of highly purified mitochondrial outer membranes. We obtained
a coverage of approximately 85\% based on the known outer membrane
proteins. The proteome represents a rich source for the analysis
of new functions of the outer membrane, including the yeast homologue
(Hfd1/Ymr110c) of the human protein causing Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.
Surprisingly, a subclass of proteins known to reside in internal
mitochondrial compartments were found in the outer membrane proteome.
These seemingly mislocalized proteins included most top scorers
of a recent genome-wide analysis for mRNAs that were targeted
to mitochondria and coded for proteins of prokaryotic origin.
Together with the enrichment of the precursor form of a matrix
protein in the outer membrane, we conclude that the mitochondrial
outer membrane not only contains resident proteins but also accumulates
a conserved subclass of preproteins destined for internal mitochondrial
compartments.}

greatest local hydrophilicity. This is accomplished by assigning
each amino acid a numerical value (hydrophilicity value) and then
repetitively averaging these values along the peptide chain. The
point of highest local average hydrophilicity is invariably located
in, or immediately adjacent to, an antigenic determinant. It was
found that the prediction success rate depended on averaging group
length, with hexapeptide averages yielding optimal results. The
method was developed using 12 proteins for which extensive immunochemical
analysis has been carried out and subsequently was used to predict
antigenic determinants for the following proteins: hepatitis B
surface antigen, influenza hemagglutinins, fowl plague virus hemagglutinin,
human histocompatibility antigen HLA-B7, human interferons, Escherichia
coli and cholera enterotoxins, ragweed allergens Ra3 and Ra5,
and streptococcal M protein. The hepatitis B surface antigen sequence
was synthesized by chemical means and was shown to have antigenic

	abstract = {Protein segments that form amphipathic alpha-helices in their
native state have periodic variation in the hydrophobicity values
of the residues along the segment, with a 3.6 residue per cycle
period characteristic of the alpha-helix. The assignment of hydrophobicity
values to amino acids (hydrophobicity scale) affects the display
of periodicity. Thirty-eight published hydrophobicity scales are
compared for their ability to identify the characteristic period
of alpha-helices, and an optimum scale for this purpose is computed
using a new eigenvector method. Two of the published scales are
also characterized by eigenvectors. We compare the usual method
for detecting periodicity based on the discrete Fourier transform
with a method based on a least-squares fit of a harmonic sequence
to a sequence of hydrophobicity values. The two become equivalent
for very long sequences, but, for shorter sequences with lengths
commonly found in alpha-helices, the least-squares procedure gives
a more reliable estimate of the period. The analog to the usual
Fourier transform power spectrum is the "least-squares power spectrum",
the sum of squares accounted for in fitting a sinusoid of given
frequency to a sequence of hydrophobicity values. The sum of the
spectra of the alpha-helices in our data base peaks at 97.5 degrees,
and approximately 50\% of the helices can account for this peak.
Thus, approximately 50\% of the alpha-helices appear to be amphipathic,
and, of those that are, the dominant frequency at 97.5 degrees
rather than 100 degrees indicates that the helix is slightly more
open than previously thought, with the number of residues per
turn closer to 3.7 than 3.6. The extra openness is examined in
crystallographic data, and is shown to be associated with the
C terminus of the helix. The alpha amphipathic index, the key
quantity in our analysis, measures the fraction of the total spectral
area that is under the 97.5 degrees peak, and is a characteristic
of hydrophobicity scales that is consistent for different sets
of helices. Our optimized scale maximizes the amphipathic index
and has a correlation of 0.85 or higher with nine previously published
scales. The most surprising feature of the optimized scale is
that arginine tends to behave as if it were hydrophobic; i.e.
in the crystallographic data base it has a tendency to be on the
hydrophobic face of teh amphipathic helix. Although the scale
is optimal only for predicting alpha-amphipathicity, it also ranks
high in identifying beta-amphipathicity and in distinguishing
interior from exterior residues in a protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

The issue of how unwanted protein association is normally avoided

of the evolution of multidomain proteins, which account for over
70\% of all eukaryotic proteins, where the effective local protein
concentration in the vicinity of each domain is very high. Here
we describe the aggregation kinetics of multidomain protein constructs
of immunoglobulin domains and the ability of different homologous
domains to aggregate together. We show that aggregation of these
proteins is a specific process and that the efficiency of coaggregation
between different domains decreases markedly with decreasing sequence
identity. Thus, whereas immunoglobulin domains with more than
about 70\% identity are highly prone to coaggregation, those with
less than 30-40\% sequence identity do not detectably interact.
A bioinformatics analysis of consecutive homologous domains in
large multidomain proteins shows that such domains almost exclusively
have sequence identities of less than 40\%, in other words below
the level at which coaggregation is likely to be efficient. We
propose that such low sequence identities could have a crucial
and general role in safeguarding proteins against misfolding and
aggregation.}

while a small number of proteins (hubs) have many interaction
partners. Hub proteins and non-hub proteins differ in several
respects; however, understanding is not complete about what properties
characterize the hubs and set them apart from proteins of low
connectivity. Therefore, we have investigated what differentiates
hubs from non-hubs and static hubs (party hubs) from dynamic hubs
(date hubs) in the protein-protein interaction network of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. RESULTS: The many interactions of hub proteins can
only partly be explained by bindings to similar proteins or domains.
It is evident that domain repeats, which are associated with binding,
are enriched in hubs. Moreover, there is an over representation
of multi-domain proteins and long proteins among the hubs. In
addition, there are clear differences between party hubs and date
hubs. Fewer of the party hubs contain long disordered regions
compared to date hubs, indicating that these regions are important
for flexible binding but less so for static interactions. Furthermore,
party hubs interact to a large extent with each other, supporting
the idea of party hubs as the cores of highly clustered functional
modules. In addition, hub proteins, and in particular party hubs,
are more often ancient. Finally, the more recent paralogs of party
hubs are underrepresented. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that
multiple and repeated domains are enriched in hub proteins and,
further, that long disordered regions, which are common in date
hubs, are particularly important for flexible binding.}

frequency of transmembrane helix kinks, which commonly occur at
proline residues. Because the proline side chain usually precludes
normal helix geometry, it is reasonable to expect that proline
residues generate these kinks. We observe, however, that the three
prolines in bacteriorhodopsin transmembrane helices can be changed
to alanine with little structural consequences. This finding leads
to a conundrum: if proline is not required for helix bending,
why are prolines commonly present at bends in transmembrane helices?
We propose an evolutionary hypothesis in which a mutation to proline
initially induces the kink. The resulting packing defects are
later repaired by further mutation, thereby locking the kink in
the structure. Thus, most prolines in extant proteins can be removed
without major structural consequences. We further propose that
nonproline kinks are places where vestigial prolines were later
removed during evolution. Consistent with this hypothesis, at
14 of 17 nonproline kinks in membrane proteins of known structure,
we find prolines in homologous sequences. Our analysis allows
us to predict kink positions with >90\% reliability. Kink prediction
indicates that different G protein-coupled receptor proteins have
different kink patterns and therefore different structures.}

and the locations of transmembrane segments for 80\% of the test
set. This compares with accuracies of 62-72\% for other popular

a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes.
In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully
predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since
it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be
on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present
Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal
peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model
(HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide
and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series
of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled
and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming
from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal
peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications
of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1\% to 3.9\% and false

	abstract = {Understanding the solvation of amino acids in biomembranes is
an important step to better explain membrane protein folding.
Several experimental studies have shown that polar residues are
both common and important in transmembrane segments, which means
they have to be solvated in the hydrophobic membrane, at least
until helices have aggregated to form integral proteins. In this
work, we have used computer simulations to unravel these interactions
on the atomic level, and classify intramembrane solvation properties
of amino acids. Simulations have been performed for systematic
mutations in poly-Leu helices, including not only each amino acid
type, but also every z-position in a model helix. Interestingly,
many polar or charged residues do not desolvate completely, but
rather retain hydration by snorkeling or pulling in water/headgroups--even
to the extent where many of them exist in a microscopic polar
environment, with hydration levels corresponding well to experimental
hydrophobicity scales. This suggests that even for polar/charged
residues a large part of solvation cost is due to entropy, not
enthalpy loss. Both hydration level and hydrogen bonding exhibit
clear position-dependence. Basic side chains cause much less membrane
distortion than acidic, since they are able to form hydrogen bonds
with carbonyl groups instead of water or headgroups. This preference
is supported by sequence statistics, where basic residues have
increased relative occurrence at carbonyl z-coordinates. Snorkeling
effects and N-/C-terminal orientation bias are directly observed,
which significantly reduces the effective thickness of the hydrophobic
core. Aromatic side chains intercalate efficiently with lipid
chains (improving Trp/Tyr anchoring to the interface) and Ser/Thr
residues are stabilized by hydroxyl groups sharing hydrogen bonds
to backbone oxygens.}

Using a novel combination of hidden Markov models and artificial
neural networks, OCTOPUS predicts the correct topology for 94\%

Both self psychology and ego psychology, with their contrasting

by Western philosophy beginning at least with Hume and Descartes.
They reflect traditional philosophic questions, notably of a homuncular
self internal to consciousness and the isolation of the subject
from other selves. Psychoanalysis has not utilized Hegel's conception
of the intersubjective origins of the self, in which the self
emerges only in an encounter with another subject, although this
approach is implicit in the work of Winnicott on the mother-infant
dyad. This movement from a one- to a two-person psychology also
presents conceptual problems, as illustrated by the psychoanalytic
theories of Sartre and Lacan, who take up opposing positions on
the status of consciousness and on intersubjectivity in the formation
of the self. Sartre's phenomenology, with its emphasis on the
questing nature of the subject in search of an identity, resonates
with contemporary theories of narcissism in which the painful
isolation of self from self-affirming and mirroring objects is
central to clinical practice. Lacan's insight into the role of
acquisition of language helps us to understand the formation of
the subject in pursuit of a virtual selfhood, as Sartre described,
but embedded within an intersubjective matrix.}

new profile-profile based alignment method for remote homology

hydrophobic interior of the membrane. We expect that, for distant
membrane protein homologs, even if the sequences have diverged
too far to be recognized, the hydrophobicity pattern and the transmembrane
topology are better conserved. By using this information in parallel
with sequence information, we show that both sensitivity and specificity
can be substantially improved for remote homology detection in
two independent test sets. In addition, we show that alignment
quality can be improved for the most distant homologs in a public
dataset of membrane protein structures. Applying the method to
the Pfam domain database, we are able to suggest new putative
evolutionary relationships for a few relatively uncharacterized

studied the evolution of multidomain architectures (MDA), guided
by evolutionary information in the form of a phylogenetic tree.
Our results show that Pfam domain families and MDAs have been
created with comparable rates (0.1-1 per million years (My)).
The major changes in DA evolution have occurred in the process
of multicellularization and within the metazoan lineage. In contrast,
creation of domains seems to have been frequent already in the
early evolution. Furthermore, most of the architectures have been
created from older domains or architectures, whereas novel domains
are mainly found in single-domain proteins. However, a particular
group of exon-bordering domains may have contributed to the rapid
evolution of novel multidomain proteins in metazoan organisms.
Finally, MDAs have evolved predominantly through insertions of
domains, whereas domain deletions are less common. In conclusion,
the rate of creation of multidomain proteins has accelerated in
the metazoan lineage, which may partly be explained by the frequent
insertion of exon-bordering domains into new architectures. However,
our results indicate that other factors have contributed as well.}

of these residues are buried within the interior of the protein

often border internal water filled cavities, even if the rest
of the sidechain is buried. A survey of their functional roles
in known structures showed that the polar residues are often directly
involved in binding of small compounds, especially in channels
and transporters, but other functions including proton transfer,
catalysis, and selectivity have also been attributed to these
proteins. Among the polar residues histidines often interact with
prosthetic groups in photosynthetic- and oxidoreductase-related
proteins, whereas prolines often are required for conformational
changes of the proteins. Indeed, the polar residues in the membrane
core are more conserved than other residues in the core, as well
as more conserved than polar residues outside the membrane. The
reason is twofold; they are often (i) buried in the interior of
the protein and (ii) directly involved in the function of the
proteins. Finally, a method to identify which polar residues are
present within the membrane core directly from protein sequences
was developed. Applying the method to the set of all human membrane

frequent among active transporter proteins and GPCRs, whereas
infrequent in families with few transmembrane regions, such as

N- and C-terminal fragments of the general AAP Gap1. Shr3 interacts
with and maintains the first five TMSs in a conformation that
can posttranslationally assemble with the remaining seven TMSs.
We also show that Doa10- and Hrd1-dependent ER-associated degradation
(ERAD) pathways redundantly degrade AAP aggregates. In combination,
doa10Delta hrd1Delta mutations stabilize AAP aggregates and partially
suppress amino acid uptake defects of shr3 mutants. Consequently,
in cells with impaired ERAD, AAPs are able to attain functional
conformations independent of Shr3. These findings illustrate that

recent CASP experiments and a larger reference set. In addition
to Modeller and Nest, a new method (Pfrag) for multiple template-based

Levitt's SegMod program. Our results show that all programs can

Here we use epitope-tagged AQP1 constructs to follow the transmembrane
(TM) orientation of key internal peptide loops in Xenopus oocyte
and cell-free systems. This analysis revealed that AQP1 maturation
in the ER involves a novel topological reorientation of three
internal TM segments and two peptide loops. After the synthesis
of TMs 4-6, TM3 underwent a 180-degree rotation in which TM3 C-terminal
flanking residues were translocated from their initial cytosolic
location into the ER lumen and N-terminal flanking residues underwent
retrograde translocation from the ER lumen to the cytosol. These
events convert TM3 from a type I to a type II topology and reposition
TM2 and TM4 into transmembrane conformations consistent with the
predicted six-segment-spanning AQP1 topology. AQP1 topological
reorientation was also associated with maturation from a protease-sensitive
conformation to a protease-resistant structure with water channel
function. These studies demonstrate that initial protein topology

polar residue substitutions are the most common disease-causing

side-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions throughout bacteriorhodopsin

we find that 4\% of polar atoms in the non-polar core regions
of membrane proteins have no hydrogen-bond partner and the lengths
of buried hydrogen bonds in soluble proteins and membrane protein
transmembrane regions are statistically identical. Our results
indicate that most hydrogen-bond interactions in membrane proteins

methods that have been developed for detergents and lipids may
be extended to membrane proteins. In particular, CG-MD simulations
of a number of membrane peptides and proteins are used to characterize
their interactions with lipid bilayers. CG-MD is used to simulate
the insertion of synthetic model membrane peptides (WALPs and
LS3) into a lipid (PC) bilayer. WALP peptides insert in a transmembrane
orientation, whilst the LS3 peptide adopts an interfacial location,
both in agreement with experimental biophysical data. This approach
is extended to a transmembrane fragment of the Vpu protein from
HIV-1, and to the coat protein from fd phage. Again, simulated
protein/membrane interactions are in good agreement with solid
state NMR data for these proteins. CG-MD has also been applied
to an M3-M4 fragment from the CFTR protein. Simulations of CFTR
M3-M4 in a detergent micelle reveal formation of an alpha-helical
hairpin, consistent with a variety of biophysical data. In an
I231D mutant, the M3-M4 hairpin is additionally stabilized via
an inter-helix Q207/D231 interaction. Finally, CG-MD simulations
are extended to a more complex membrane protein, the bacterial
sugar transporter LacY. Comparison of a 200 ns CG-MD simulation
of LacY in a DPPC bilayer with a 50 ns atomistic simulation of
the same protein in a DMPC bilayer shows that the two methods

a dynamic pathway through which the elongating nascent polypeptide

Probes were inserted at sequential sites within TM2 of the aquaporin-1
water channel by in vitro translation of truncated mRNAs. TM2
first contacted Sec61alpha when the probe was positioned approximately
38 residues from the ribosome peptidyltransferase center, and
TM2-Sec61alpha photoadducts decreased markedly when the probe
was >80 residues from the peptidyltransferase center. Unexpectedly,
as nascent chain length was gradually extended, photocross-linking
at multiple sites within TM2 abruptly and transiently decreased,
indicating that TM2 initially entered, withdrew, and then re-entered
Sec61alpha. This brief reduction in TM2 photocross-linking coincided
with TM3 synthesis. Replacement of TM3 with a secretory reporter
domain or introduction of proline residues into TM3 changed the
TM2 cross-linking profile and this biphasic behavior. These findings
demonstrate that the primary and likely secondary structure of

CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals

for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative
genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number variable regions
(CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or
losses, covering 360 megabases (12\% of the genome) were identified
in these populations. These CNVRs contained hundreds of genes,
disease loci, functional elements and segmental duplications.
Notably, the CNVRs encompassed more nucleotide content per genome
than SNPs, underscoring the importance of CNV in genetic diversity
and evolution. The data obtained delineate linkage disequilibrium
patterns for many CNVs, and reveal marked variation in copy number
among populations. We also demonstrate the utility of this resource
for genetic disease studies.}

Here, we analyze the mapping between sequence and structure in
a set of structurally aligned protein domains. To avoid artifacts,
we restricted our attention only to the core components of these
structures. We found that on average, using different measures
of structural change, protein cores evolve linearly with evolutionary
distance (amino acid substitutions per site). This is true irrespective
of which measure of structural change we used, whether RMSD or
discrete structural descriptors for secondary structure, accessibility,
or contacts. This linear response allows us to quantify the claim
that structure is more conserved than sequence. Using structural
alphabets of similar cardinality to the sequence alphabet, structural
cores evolve three to ten times slower than sequences. Although
we observed an average linear response, we found a wide variance.
Different domain families varied fivefold in structural response
to evolution. An attempt to categorically analyze this variance
among subgroups by structural and functional category revealed
only one statistically significant trend. This trend can be explained
by the fact that beta-sheets change faster than alpha-helices,
most likely due to that they are shorter and that change occurs
at the ends of the secondary structure elements.}

no homology to known domains or proteins can be detected. These
sequences are often referred to as orphans. Surprisingly, it has
been reported that the large number of orphans is sustained in
spite of a rapid increase of available genomic sequences. However,
it is believed that de novo creation of coding sequences is rare
in comparison to mechanisms such as domain shuffling and gene
duplication; hence, most sequences should have homologs in other
genomes. To investigate this, the sequences of 19 complete fungi
genomes were compared. By using the phylogenetic relationship
between these genomes, we could identify potentially de novo created
orphans in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that only a small
fraction, <2\%, of the S. cerevisiae proteome is orphan, which
confirms that de novo creation of coding sequences is indeed rare.
Furthermore, we found it necessary to compare the most closely
related species to distinguish between de novo created sequences
and rapidly evolving sequences where homologs are present but
cannot be detected. Next, the orphan proteins (OPs) and orphan
domains (ODs) were characterized. First, it was observed that
both OPs and ODs are short. In addition, at least some of the
OPs have been shown to be functional in experimental assays, showing
that they are not pseudogenes. Furthermore, in contrast to what
has been reported before and what is seen for older orphans, S.
cerevisiae specific ODs and proteins are not more disordered than
other proteins. This might indicate that many of the older, and
earlier classified, orphans indeed are fast-evolving sequences.
Finally, >90\% of the detected ODs are located at the protein
termini, which suggests that these orphans could have been created
by mutations that have affected the start or stop codons.}

Furthermore, the results show that the modification introduced

now a correlation coefficient above 0.9 is achieved, whereas the
correlation for ProQ is about 0.7. The correlation is better for
the easier than for the harder targets, but it is not below 0.5

biases on some of the protein properties suggested to be enriched

interactivity. We find that protein abundance is the most important
factor for detecting interactions in tandem affinity purifications
(TAP), while it is of less importance for Yeast Two Hybrid (Y2H)
screens. Consequently, sequence conservation and/or essentiality
of hubs may be related to their high abundance. Further, proteins
with disordered structure are over-represented in Y2H screens
and in one, but not the other, large-scale TAP assay. Hence, disordered
regions may be important both in transient interactions and interactions
in complexes. Finally, a few domain families seem to be responsible
for a large part of all interactions. Most importantly, we show
that there are method-specific biases in PPI experiments. Thus,
care should be taken before drawing strong conclusions based on

(2DSEC) to analyse variability in secondary structure compositions

2DSEC detects inserted secondary structures that embellish the
core of conserved secondary structures found throughout the superfamily.
Analysis showed that for 56\% of highly populated superfamilies
(>9 sequence diverse relatives), there are twofold or more increases
in the numbers of secondary structures in some relatives. In some
families fivefold increases occur, sometimes modifying the fold
of the domain. Manual inspection of secondary structure insertions
or embellishments in 48 particularly variable superfamilies revealed
that although these insertions were usually discontiguous in the
sequence they were often co-located in 3D resulting in a larger
structural motif that often modified the geometry of the active
site or the surface conformation promoting diverse domain partnerships
and protein interactions. These observations, supported by automatic
analysis of all well populated CATH families, suggest that accretion
of small secondary structure insertions may provide a simple mechanism
for evolving new functions in diverse relatives. Some layered
domain architectures (e.g. mainly-beta and alpha-beta sandwiches)
that recur highly in the genomes more frequently exploit these
types of embellishments to modify function. In these architectures,
aggregation occurs most often at the edges, top or bottom of the
beta-sheets. Information on structural variability across domain
superfamilies has been made available through the CATH Dictionary

Molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and energy minimization

more stringent test for refinement was performed on 729 near-native
decoys for each native protein. We use a powerfully convergent
energy minimization method to show that implicit solvent (GBSA)
provides greater improvement for some proteins than the KB potential:
24 of 75 proteins showing an average improvement of >20\% in C(alpha)
rmsd from the native structure with GBSA, compared to just 7 proteins
with KB. Molecular dynamics in explicit solvent moved the structures
further away from their native conformation than the initial,
unrefined decoys. Implicit solvent gives rise to a deep, smooth
potential energy attractor basin that pulls toward the native

has come from working with fragments of nebulin, containing from

hidden Markov models with standard-sequence-search methods. Further,
we combine the use of predicted secondary structures and multiple
sequence alignments into a combined method that performs better
than methods that do not use this combination of information.
Using only single sequences, the correct fold of a protein was
detected for 10\% of the test cases in our benchmark. Including
multiple sequence information increased this number to 16\%, and
when predicted secondary structure information was included as
well, the fold was correctly identified in 20\% of the cases.
Moreover, if the correct secondary structure was used, 27\% of
the proteins could be correctly matched to a fold. For comparison,
blast2, fasta, and ssearch identifies the fold correctly in 13-17\%
of the cases. Thus, standard pairwise sequence search methods
perform almost as well as hidden Markov models in our benchmark.
This is probably because the automatically-created multiple sequence
alignments used in this study do not contain enough diversity
and because the current generation of hidden Markov models do
not perform very well when built from a few sequences.}

features to train a second SVM to predict residue contacts which
are then used to determine helix-helix interaction with up to
65\% accuracy under stringent cross-validation on a non-redundant

decoy helical packing arrangements with up to 70\% accuracy. Finally,
we employ a force-directed algorithm to construct the optimal
helical packing arrangement which demonstrates success for proteins

to the organization of a cell, in particular in eukaryotes. They
are known to evolve through internal tandem duplications. However,
the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is incomplete.
To shed light on repeat expansion mechanisms, we have studied
the evolution of the muscle protein Nebulin, a protein that contains
a large number of actin-binding nebulin domains. Nebulin proteins
have evolved from an invertebrate precursor containing two nebulin
domains. Repeat regions have expanded through duplications of
single domains, as well as duplications of a super repeat (SR)
consisting of seven nebulins. We show that the SR has evolved
independently into large regions in at least three instances:
twice in the invertebrate Branchiostoma floridae and once in vertebrates.
In-depth analysis reveals several recent tandem duplications in
the Nebulin gene. The events involve both single-domain and multidomain
SR units or several SR units. There are single events, but frequently
the same unit is duplicated multiple times. For instance, an ancestor
of human and chimpanzee underwent two tandem duplications. The
duplication junction coincides with an Alu transposon, thus suggesting
duplication through Alu-mediated homologous recombination. Duplications
in the SR region consistently involve multiples of seven domains.
However, the exact unit that is duplicated varies both between
species and within species. Thus, multiple tandem duplications
of the same motif did not create the large Nebulin protein. Finally,
analysis of segmental duplications in the human genome reveals
that duplications are more common in genes containing domain repeats
than in those coding for nonrepeated proteins. In fact, segmental
duplications are found three to six times more often in long repeated
genes than expected by chance.}

to bury hydrophobic residues and to expose polar and charged residues.
In contrast to water soluble proteins, transmembrane proteins
face three distinct environments; a hydrophobic lipid environment
inside the membrane, a hydrophilic water environment outside the

Therefore, it is energetically favorable for transmembrane proteins
to expose different types of residues in the different regions.
RESULTS: Investigations of a set of structurally determined transmembrane
proteins showed that the composition of solvent exposed residues
differs significantly inside and outside the membrane. In contrast,
residues buried within the interior of a protein show a much smaller
difference. However, in all regions exposed residues are less
conserved than buried residues. Further, we found that current
state-of-the-art predictors for surface area are optimized for
one of the regions and perform badly in the other regions. To
circumvent this limitation we developed a new predictor, MPRAP,
that performs well in all regions. In addition, MPRAP performs
better on complete membrane proteins than a combination of specialized
predictors and acceptably on water-soluble proteins. A web-server
of MPRAP is available at \verb+http://mprap.cbr.su.se+/ CONCLUSION:
By including complete a-helical transmembrane proteins in the

The instantaneous relaxation of the dielectric shielding provided

a lot of statistical noise. Despite these advantages, it has been
difficult for generalized Born implementations to significantly
outperform optimized explicit-water simulations due to more complex
functional forms and the two extra interaction stages necessary
to calculate Born radii and the derivative chain rule terms contributing
to the force. Here, we present a method that uses a rescaling
transformation to make the standard generalized Born expression
a function of a single variable, which enables an efficient tabulated
implementation on any modern CPU hardware. The total performance
is within a factor 2 of simulations in vacuo. The algorithm has
been implemented in Gromacs, including single-instruction multiple-data
acceleration, for three different Born radius models and corresponding
chain rule terms. We have also adapted the model to work with
the virtual interaction sites commonly used for hydrogens to enable
long-time steps, which makes it possible to achieve a simulation

exposure, these changes were irreversible. In this study, we investigated
the irreversible changes induced in ER-1 cells by a 1-month exposure
to EGF and the possible involvement of oxidative stress. METHODS:
ER-1 cells were treated with EGF (100 ng/mL) for 1 month in the
presence or absence of an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine or selenium,
and compared with untreated control ER-1 cells. We assessed tumor
progression by measuring intracellular peroxide levels, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine
(a marker for oxidative DNA damage) levels, in vitro invasiveness,
and in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic ability. All statistical
tests are two-sided. RESULTS: After ER-1 cells were treated for
1 month with EGF, levels of intracellular peroxide and 8-hydroxyguanosine
in the DNA of treated cells were higher than those in the DNA
of control cells, and treated ER-1 cells were more tumorigenic
and metastatic in vivo and more invasive in vitro than untreated
control cells (all P<.001). Levels of 8-hydroxyguanosine in DNA
increased as the length of the EGF treatment increased (P<.001).
However, when N-acetylcysteine or selenium was added with EGF
for 1 month, levels of intracellular peroxide and 8-hydroxyguanosine
in DNA were comparable to those in control cells (r =.795). Both
tumorigenicity (P =.008) and metastatic ability (P<.001) decreased
after addition of N-acetylcysteine or selenium. CONCLUSION: The
irreversible changes caused by continuous EGF stimulation of ER-1
cells result from increased oxidative damage in the DNA, which
generates tumor cells with more malignant characteristics.}

	abstract = {It is well documented that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved
in the aetiology of age related diseases. Over the last decades,
strong efforts have been made to identify antioxidants in human
foods and numerous promising compounds have been detected which
are used for the production of supplements and functional foods.
The present paper describes the advantages and limitations of
methods which are currently used for the identification of antioxidants.
Numerous in vitro methods are available which are easy to perform
and largely used in screening trials. However, the results of
such tests are only partly relevant for humans as certain active
compounds (e.g. those with large molecular configuration) are
only poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and/or may
undergo metabolic degradation. Therefore experimental models are
required which provide information if protective effects take
place in humans under realistic conditions. Over the last years,
several methods have been developed which are increasingly used
in human intervention trials. The most widely used techniques
are chemical determinations of oxidised guanosine in peripheral
blood cells or urine and single cell gel electrophoresis (comet)
assays with lymphocytes which are based on the measurement of
DNA migration in an electric field. By using of DNA-restriction
enzymes (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease
III) it is possible to monitor the endogenous formation of oxidised
purines and pyrimidines; recently also protocols have been developed
which enable to monitor alterations in the repair of oxidised
DNA. Alternatively, also the frequency of micronucleated cells
can be monitored with the cytokinesis block method in peripheral
human blood cells before and after intervention with putative
antioxidants. To obtain information on alterations of the sensitivity
towards oxidative damage, the cells can be treated ex vivo with
ROS (H(2)O(2) exposure, radiation). The evaluation of currently
available human studies shows that in approximately half of them
protective effects of dietary factors towards oxidative DNA-damage
were observed. Earlier studies focused predominantly on the effects
of vitamins (A, C, E) and carotenoids, more recently also the
effects of fruit juices (from grapes, kiwi) and beverages (soy
milk, tea, coffee), vegetables (tomato products, berries, Brussels
sprouts) and other components of the human diet (coenzyme Q(10),
polyunsaturated fatty acids) were investigated. On the basis of
the results of these studies it was possible to identify dietary
compounds which are highly active (e.g. gallic acid). At present,
strong efforts are made to elucidate whether the different parameters
of oxidative DNA-damage correlates with life span, cancer and
other age related diseases. The new techniques are highly useful
tools which provide valuable information if dietary components
cause antioxidant effects in humans and can be used to identify
individual protective compounds and also to develop nutritional
strategies to reduce the adverse health effects of ROS.}

Sphingolipids are structural components of membranes and can also

binding to transmembrane domains (TMDs) of proteins within the
hydrophobic bilayer, and how this could affect protein function.
Here we show a direct and highly specific interaction of exclusively
one sphingomyelin species, SM 18, with the TMD of the COPI machinery
protein p24 (ref. 2). Strikingly, the interaction depends on both
the headgroup and the backbone of the sphingolipid, and on a signature
sequence (VXXTLXXIY) within the TMD. Molecular dynamics simulations
show a close interaction of SM 18  with the TMD. We suggest a
role of SM 18 in regulating the equilibrium between an inactive
monomeric and an active oligomeric state of the p24 protein, which
in turn regulates COPI-dependent transport. Bioinformatic analyses
predict that the  signature sequence represents a conserved sphingolipid-binding
cavity in a variety of mammalian membrane proteins. Thus, in addition
to a function as second messengers, sphingolipids can act as cofactors
to regulate the function of transmembrane proteins. Our discovery
of an unprecedented specificity of interaction of a TMD with an
individual sphingolipid species adds to our understanding of why
biological membranes are assembled from such a large variety of

number of antiparallel duplications and parallel duplications
were found. However, of all 11 superfamilies with an internal
duplication, only for one, the AcrB Multidrug Efflux Pump, the
duplicated unit could be found in its nonduplicated form. An evolutionary
analysis of the AcrB homologs indicates that several independent
fusions have occurred, including the fusion of the SecD and SecF
proteins into the 12-TM-protein SecDF in Brucella and Staphylococcus
aureus. In one additional  case, the Vitamin B12 transporter-like
ABC transporters, the protein had undergone an additional fusion
to form protein with 20 TM-helices in several bacterial genomes.
Finally, homologs to all human membrane proteins were used to
detect the presence of duplicated and nonduplicated proteins.
This confirmed that only in rare cases can homologs with different
duplication status be found, although internal symmetry is frequent

that duplication and fusion events happen simultaneously and that
there is almost always a strong selective advantage for the fused

Tob55 is part of the hetero-oligomeric TOB (topogenesis of mitochondrial

RESULTS: Here we mined the human proteome and identified the membrane
proteome subset using three prediction tools for alpha-helices:
Phobius, TMHMM, and SOSUI. This dataset was reduced to a non-redundant
set by aligning it to the human genome and then clustered with
our  own interactive implementation of the ISODATA algorithm.
The genes were classified and each protein group was manually
curated, virtually evaluating each sequence of the clusters, applying
systematic comparisons with a range of databases and other resources.
We identified 6,718 human membrane proteins and classified the
majority of them into 234 families of which 151 belong to the
three major functional groups: receptors (63 groups, 1,352 members),
transporters (89 groups, 817 members) or enzymes (7 groups, 533
members). Also, 74 miscellaneous groups with 697 members were
determined. Interestingly, we find that 41\% of the membrane proteins
are singlets with no apparent affiliation or identity to any human
protein family. Our results identify major differences between
the human membrane proteome and the ones in unicellular organisms
and we  also show a strong bias towards certain membrane topologies
for different functional classes: 77\% of all transporters have
more than six helices while 60\%  of proteins with an enzymatic
function and 88\% receptors, that are not GPCRs, have only one
single membrane spanning alpha-helix. Further, we have identified
and characterized new gene families and novel members of existing
families. CONCLUSION: Here we present the most detailed roadmap
of gene numbers and families to our knowledge, which is an important
step towards an overall classification of the entire human proteome.
We estimate that 27\% of the total human proteome are alpha-helical
transmembrane proteins and provide an extended classification

functional, structural, and evolutionary features.}

orientations in the membrane and formed antiparallel homodimers.
Here, we present a detailed analysis of the DUF606 family of bacterial
membrane proteins that contains the entire collection of intermediate
states of such an evolutionary pathway: single genes that would
code for dual topology homodimeric proteins, paired genes coding
for homologous proteins with a fixed but opposite orientation
in the membrane that would form heterodimers, and fused genes
that encode antiparallel two-domain fusion proteins. Two types
of paired genes can be discriminated corresponding to the order
in which the genes coding for the two oppositely oriented proteins
occur in the operon. On the protein level, the heterodimers resulting
from the two types of gene pairs are indistinguishable. In contrast,
two types of fused genes corresponding to the two possible orders
in which the oppositely oriented domains are present in the encoded
proteins, do result in discernible types of proteins. The large
number of genetic and protein  states in the DUF606 family allowed
for a detailed phylogenic analysis that revealed a total of nine
independent duplication events in the DUF606 family, five of which
resulted in paired genes, and four resulted in fused genes. Noticeably,
there was no evidence for a sequential mechanism in which fusions
evolve from a pair of genes. Rather, an evolutionary mechanism
is proposed by which antiparallel two-domain proteins are the
direct result of a gene duplication event. Combining the phylogeny
of proteins and hosting microorganisms allowed for a reconstruction

critical for maintaining the native fold of a protein, remains
an open problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. Interest
in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic
improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families.
Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function
prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions
are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs), most commonly through the information-theoretic
approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites
in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the
true covariation signal in the MSA is often masked by biases from
many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here
we present a novel method, PSICOV, which introduces the use of
sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein
contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously
demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation
noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly
coupled mutation correlations in the MSA. RESULTS: PSICOV displays
a mean precision substantially better than the best performing
normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks.
For 118  out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions
for a protein of length L)  precision for long-range contacts
(sequence separation >23) was >/= 0.5, which represents an improvement
sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction

The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences
of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches
to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have
been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions
in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important
shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly
and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that
combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted
from use in statistical physics. Applied to a  set of >2,500 representatives
of the bacterial two-component signal transduction  system, the
combination of covariance with global inference successfully and
robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without
resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions
between sensor kinase (SK)  and response regulator (RR) proteins
and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular
success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness  of the
global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based
on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable
soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only
1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues
to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the
potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on
the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the
foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein

ultimate challenges in computational biology. Given the large
amount of available sequence data, the analysis of co-evolution,
i.e., statistical dependency, between columns in multiple alignments

avenues for predicting residues that are contacting in the structure.
A key impediment to this approach is that strong statistical dependencies
are also  observed for many residue pairs that are distal in the
structure. Using a comprehensive analysis of protein domains with
available three-dimensional structures we show that co-evolving
contacts very commonly form chains that percolate through the
protein structure, inducing indirect statistical dependencies
between many distal pairs of residues. We characterize the distributions
of length and spatial distance traveled by these co-evolving contact
chains and show that they explain a large fraction of observed
statistical dependencies between structurally distal pairs. We
adapt a recently developed Bayesian network model into a rigorous
procedure for disentangling direct from indirect statistical dependencies,
and we demonstrate that this method not only successfully accomplishes
this task, but also allows contacts with weak statistical dependency
to be detected. To illustrate how additional information can be
incorporated into our method, we incorporate a phylogenetic correction,
and we develop an informative prior that takes into account that
the  probability for a pair of residues to contact depends strongly
on their primary-sequence distance and the amount of conservation
that the corresponding columns in the multiple alignment exhibit.
We show that our model including these extensions dramatically
improves the accuracy of contact prediction from multiple sequence

direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently
introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally
efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the
accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a  large number of protein
domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to
yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating
the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the
protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear
signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from
alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings,
and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings
suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable
guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein
conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo
prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence

is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs
record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in
which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering
the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting
it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable
challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is
amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic
sequencing.In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary
constraints from a set of sequence homologs of  a protein. The
challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the
noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge
using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained
by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer
residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength
of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue
proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue
couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define
the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.We quantify this
observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures
of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging
in size from 50 to 260 residues, including a G-protein coupled
receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do
not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known
structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information
to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 A C(alpha)-RMSD
error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds
of the protein (method called EVfold, details at \verb+http://EVfold.org+).
This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining
protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of
the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein

and the remaining four helices pack in a row to form a  flat,
'panel'-like domain. Overall, the architecture of the protein
is remarkably similar to the sodium/proton antiporter NhaA, despite
having no detectable sequence homology. The ASBT(NM) structure
was captured with the substrate taurocholate present, bound between

Despite their obvious structural  regularity, evidence for an

We use three complementary approaches to show that all OMBBs from
Gram-negative bacteria evolved from a single, ancestral beta beta
hairpin. First, we link almost all families of known single-chain
bacterial OMBBs with each other through transitive profile searches.
Second, we identify a clear repeat signature in the sequences
of many OMBBs in which the repeating sequence unit coincides with
the structural beta beta hairpin repeat. Third, we show that the
observed sequence similarity between OMBB hairpins cannot be explained
by structural or membrane constraints on their sequences. The
third approach addresses a longstanding problem in protein evolution:
how to distinguish between a very remotely homologous relationship
and the opposing scenario of "sequence convergence." The origin
of a diverse group of proteins from a single hairpin module supports
the hypothesis that, around the time of transition from the RNA

been shown experimentally that insertion can be accomplished by
hydrophobic counterbalance, predicting an arginine insertion cost
of only 2.5 kcal/mol, compared with 14.9 kcal/mol in cyclohexane.
Previous simulations of pure bilayers have produced values close
to the pure hydrocarbon,  which has lead to spirited discussion
about the experimental conditions. Here, we have performed computer
simulations of models better mimicking biological membranes by
explicitly including protein helices at mass fractions from 15\%
to 55\%, as well as an actual translocon. This has a striking
effect on the solvation free energy of arginine. With some polar
residues present, the solvation cost comes close to experimental
observation at approximately 30\% mass fraction, and negligible
at 40\%. In the presence of a translocon in the membrane, the
cost of inserting arginine next to the lateral gate can be as
low as 3-5 kcal/mol. The effect is mainly due to the extra helices
making it easier to retain hydration water. These results offer
a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the in vivo
hydrophobicity scale and computer simulations and highlight the
importance of the high protein contents in membranes. Although
many membrane proteins are stable in pure bilayers, such simplified

the longest indels, ordered and disordered alike, occur toward

topology of membrane proteins has been reported to be above 80\%.
However, this performance has only been observed in small and
possibly biased data sets obtained from protein structures or
biochemical assays. Here, we test a number of topology predictors
on an "unseen" set of proteins of known structure and also on
four "genome-scale" data sets, including one recent large set
of experimentally validated human membrane proteins with glycosylated
sites. The set of glycosylated proteins is also used to examine
the ability of prediction methods to separate membrane from nonmembrane
proteins. The results show that methods utilizing multiple sequence
alignments are overall superior to methods that do not. The best
performance is obtained by TOPCONS, a consensus method that combines
several of the other prediction methods. The best methods to distinguish
membrane from nonmembrane proteins belong to the "Phobius" group
of predictors. We further observe that the reported high accuracies
in the smaller benchmark sets are not quite maintained in larger
scale benchmarks. Instead, we estimate the performance of the
best prediction methods for eukaryotic membrane proteins to be
between 60\% and 70\%. The low agreement between predictions from
different methods questions earlier estimates about the global
properties of the membrane proteome. Finally, we suggest a pipeline
to estimate these properties using a combination of the best predictors
that could be applied in large-scale proteomics studies of membrane
proteins.}

biophysics, molecular evolution, and molecular population genetics
forms the foundations for  a mechanistic understanding of many
aspects of protein biochemistry. Current efforts in interdisciplinary
protein modeling are in their infancy and the state-of-the art
of such models is described. Beyond the relationship between amino
acid substitution and static protein structure, protein function,
and corresponding organismal fitness, other considerations are
also discussed. More complex mutational processes such as insertion
and deletion and domain rearrangements and even circular permutations
should be evaluated. The role of intrinsically disordered proteins
is still controversial, but may be increasingly important to consider.
Protein geometry and protein dynamics as a deviation from  static
considerations of protein structure are also important. Protein
expression level is known to be a major determinant of evolutionary
rate and several considerations including selection at the mRNA
level and the role of interaction  specificity are discussed.
Lastly, the relationship between modeling and needed high-throughput
experimental data as well as experimental examination of protein
evolution using ancestral sequence resurrection and in vitro biochemistry
are presented, towards an aim of ultimately generating better
models for biological inference and prediction.}

in tandem repeats, performing broad functions often related to
cellular organization. For instance, the eukaryotic protein filamin
interacts with many proteins and is crucial for the cytoskeleton.
The functional properties of long repeat domains are governed
by the specific properties of each individual domain as well as
by the repeat copy number. To provide better understanding of
the evolutionary and functional history of repeating domains,
we investigated the mode of evolution of the filamin domain in
some detail. Among the domains that are common in long repeat
proteins, sushi and spectrin domains evolve primarily through
cassette tandem duplications while scavenger and immunoglobulin
repeats appear to evolve through clustered tandem duplications.
Additionally, immunoglobulin and filamin repeats exhibit a unique
pattern where every other domain shows high sequence similarity.
This pattern may be the result of tandem duplications, serve to
avert aggregation between adjacent domains or it is the result
of functional constraints. In filamin, our studies confirm the
presence of interspersed integrin binding domains in vertebrates,
while invertebrates exhibit more varied  patterns, including more
clustered integrin binding domains. The most notable case is leech
filamin, which contains a 20 repeat expansion and exhibits unique
dimerization topology. Clearly, invertebrate filamins are varied
and contain examples of similar adjacent integrin-binding domains.
Given that invertebrate integrin shows more similarity to the
weaker filamin binder, integrin beta3, it is possible that the
distance between integrin-binding domains is not as crucial  for
invertebrate filamins as for vertebrates.}

transverse tubules around each sarcomere. Three giant, muscle-specific
proteins, titin (3-4 MDa), nebulin (600-800 kDa), and obscurin
(approximately 720-900 kDa), have been proposed to play important
roles in the assembly and stabilization of sarcomeres. There is
a large amount of data showing that each of these molecules interacts
with several to many different protein ligands, regulating their
activity and localizing them to particular sites within or surrounding
sarcomeres. Consistent with this, mutations in each of these proteins
have been linked to skeletal and cardiac myopathies or to muscular
dystrophies. The evidence that any of them plays a role as a "molecular
template," "molecular  blueprint," or "molecular ruler" is less
definitive, however. Here we review the  structure and function
of titin, nebulin, and obscurin, with the literature supporting
a role for them as scaffolding molecules and the contradictory
evidence regarding their roles as molecular guides in sarcomerogenesis.}

autosomal dominant atelosteogenesis (AO) and the Larsen group

particular FLNB protein domains and act in a presumptive gain-of-function
mechanism. In contrast the loss-of-function disorder, spondylocarpotarsal
synostosis syndrome, is characterised by the complete absence
of FLNB. One cluster of AO missense mutations is found within
the second of two calponin homology (CH) domains that create a
functional actin-binding domain (ABD). This N-terminal ABD is
required for filamin F-actin crosslinking activity, a crucial
aspect of filamin's role of integrating cell-signalling events
with cellular scaffolding and mechanoprotection. This study characterises
the wild type FLNB ABD and investigates the effects of two disease-associated
mutations on the structure and function of the FLNB ABD that could
explain a gain-of-function mechanism for the AO diseases. We have
determined high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the human
filamin B wild type ABD, plus W148R and M202V mutants. All three
structures display the classic  compact monomeric conformation
for the ABD with the CH1 and CH2 domains in close  contact. The
conservation of tertiary structure in the presence of these mutations
shows that the compact ABD conformation is stable to the sequence
substitutions. In solution the mutant ABDs display reduced melting
temperatures (by 6-7 degrees C) as determined by differential
scanning fluorimetry. Characterisation of the wild type and mutant
ABD F-actin binding activities via co-sedimentation assays shows
that the mutant FLNB ABDs have increased F-actin binding affinities,
with dissociation constants of 2.0 microM (W148R) and 0.56 microM
(M202V), compared to the wild type ABD K(d) of 7.0 microM. The
increased F-actin binding affinity of the mutants presents a biochemical
mechanism that differentiates the autosomal dominant gain-of-function
FLNB disorders from those  that arise through the complete loss
of FLNB protein.}

and cancer. METHODS: Using gastric epithelial cells, we analyzed
a set of H pylori strains and mutants for their ability to interact
with CD46 and/or influence CD46 expression. Bacterial interaction
with full-length CD46 and small CD46 peptides was evaluated by
flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay, and bacterial survival analyses. RESULTS: H pylori infection
caused shedding of CD46 into the extracellular environment. A
soluble form of CD46 bound to H pylori and inhibited growth, in
a dose- and time-dependent manner, by interacting with urease
and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, which are essential bacterial
pathogenicity-associated factors. Binding of CD46 or CD46-derived
synthetic peptides blocked the urease activity and ability of
bacteria to survive in acidic environments. Oral administration
of one CD46 peptide eradicated H pylori from infected mice. CONCLUSIONS:
CD46 is an antimicrobial agent that can eradicate H pylori. CD46
peptides might be developed to treat H pylori infection.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Employing methods to assess the quality of modeled
protein structures is now standard practice in bioinformatics.
In a broad sense, the techniques can  be divided into methods
relying on consensus prediction on the one hand, and single-model
methods on the other. Consensus methods frequently perform very
well when there is a clear consensus, but this is not always the
case. In particular,  they frequently fail in selecting the best
possible model in the hard cases (lacking consensus) or in the
easy cases where models are very similar. In contrast, single-model
methods do not suffer from these drawbacks and could potentially
be applied on any protein of interest to assess quality or as
a scoring function for sampling-based refinement. RESULTS: Here,
we present a new single-model method, ProQ2, based on ideas from
its predecessor, ProQ. ProQ2 is a model quality assessment algorithm
that uses support vector machines to predict local as well as
global quality of protein models. Improved performance is obtained
by combining previously used features with updated structural
and predicted features. The most important contribution can be
attributed to the use  of profile weighting of the residue specific
features and the use features averaged over the whole model even
though the prediction is still local. CONCLUSIONS: ProQ2 is significantly
better than its predecessors at detecting high quality models,
improving the sum of Z-scores for the selected first-ranked  models
by 20\% and 32\% compared to the second-best single-model method
in CASP8 and CASP9, respectively. The absolute quality assessment
of the models at both local and global level is also improved.
The Pearson's correlation between the correct and local predicted
score is improved from 0.59 to 0.70 on CASP8 and from 0.62 to
0.68 on CASP9; for global score to the correct GDT_TS from 0.75
to 0.80 and from 0.77 to 0.80 again compared to the second-best
single methods in CASP8 and CASP9, respectively. ProQ2 is available

been quite successful at discriminating between high- and low-quality
protein structures. Here, we show that it is possible to improve
this performance significantly by restricting the learning space
to a specific context, in this case membrane proteins. Since these
are among the most important structures from a pharmaceutical
point-of-view, it is particularly interesting to resolve local
model quality for regions corresponding, e.g. to binding sites.
RESULTS: Our new  ProQM method uses a support vector machine with
a combination of general and membrane protein-specific features.
For the transmembrane region, ProQM clearly outperforms all methods
developed for generic proteins, and it does so while maintaining
performance for extra-membrane domains; in this region it is only
matched by ProQres. The predictor is shown to accurately predict
quality both on  the global and local level when applied to GPCR
models, and clearly outperforms consensus-based scoring. Finally,
the combination of ProQM and the Rosetta low-resolution energy
function achieve a 7-fold enrichment in selection of near-native
structural models, at very limited computational cost. AVAILABILITY:
ProQM is available as a server at +proqm.cbr.su.se+.}

Functional modules, often tantamount to structural domains or
smaller fragments, are in many cases well conserved but reoccur
in a different order and across many protein families. The underlying
genetic mechanisms are gene duplication, fusion, and loss of sequence
fragments. As a consequence, the sequential order of domains can
be inverted, leading to what is known as circularly permutated
proteins. Using a  recently developed algorithm, we have identified
a large number of such rearrangements and analyzed their evolutionary
history. We searched for examples  which have arisen by one of
the three postulated mechanisms: independent fusion/fission, "duplication/deletion,"
and plasmid-mediated "cut and paste." We  conclude that all three
mechanisms can be observed, with the independent fusion/fission
being the most frequent. This can be partly attributed to highly
mobile domains. Duplication/deletion has been found in modular
proteins such as peptide synthases.}

	abstract = {Many protein families are common to all cellular organisms, indicating
that many  genes have ancient origins. Genetic variation is mostly
attributed to processes such as mutation, duplication, and rearrangement
of ancient modules. Thus it is widely assumed that much of present-day
genetic diversity can be traced by common ancestry to a molecular
"big bang." A rarely considered alternative is that proteins may
arise continuously de novo. One mechanism of generating different
coding sequences is by "overprinting," in which an existing nucleotide
sequence is translated de novo in a different reading frame or
from noncoding open reading frames. The clearest evidence for
overprinting is provided when the original gene function is retained,
as in overlapping genes. Analysis of their phylogenies indicates
which are the original genes and which are their informationally
novel  partners. We report here the phylogenetic relationships
of overlapping coding sequences from steroid-related receptor
genes and from tymovirus, luteovirus, and lentivirus genomes.
For each pair of overlapping coding sequences, one is confined
to a single lineage, whereas the other is more widespread. This
suggests that the phylogenetically restricted coding sequence
arose only in the progenitor of that lineage by translating an
out-of-frame sequence to yield the new polypeptide. The production
of novel exons by alternative splicing in thyroid receptor and
lentivirus genes suggests that introns can be a valuable evolutionary
source for overprinting. New genes and their products may drive
major evolutionary changes.}

that are for the most part, uncharacterized both genetically and
biochemically. We report here a metagenomic study of the marine
planktonic microbiota in which surface (mostly marine) water samples
were analyzed as part of the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling
expedition. These samples, collected across a several-thousand
km transect from the North Atlantic through the Panama Canal and
ending in the South Pacific yielded an extensive dataset consisting
of 7.7 million sequencing reads (6.3 billion bp). Though a few
major microbial clades dominate the planktonic marine niche, the
dataset contains great diversity with 85\% of the assembled sequence
and 57\% of the unassembled data being unique at a 98\% sequence
identity cutoff. Using the metadata associated with each sample
and sequencing library, we developed new comparative genomic and
assembly methods. One comparative genomic method, termed "fragment
recruitment," addressed questions of genome structure, evolution,
and taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity, as well as the biochemical
diversity of genes and gene families. A second method, termed
"extreme assembly," made possible the assembly and reconstruction
of large segments of abundant but clearly nonclonal organisms.
Within all abundant populations analyzed, we found extensive intra-ribotype
diversity in several forms: (1) extensive sequence variation within
orthologous regions throughout a given genome; despite coverage
of individual ribotypes approaching 500-fold, most individual
sequencing reads are unique; (2) numerous changes in gene content
some with direct adaptive implications; and (3) hypervariable
genomic islands that are too variable to assemble. The intra-ribotype
diversity is organized into genetically isolated populations that
have overlapping but independent distributions, implying distinct
environmental preference. We present novel methods for measuring
the genomic similarity between metagenomic samples and show how
they may be grouped into several community types. Specific functional
adaptations can be identified both within individual ribotypes
and across the entire community, including proteorhodopsin spectral
tuning and the presence or absence of the phosphate-binding gene

We report here the identification of a new striated muscle Z-disc associated protein: lasp-2 (LIM and SH3 domain protein-2). Lasp-2 is the most recently identified member of the nebulin family. To evaluate the role of lasp-2 in striated muscle, lasp-2 gene expression and localization were studied in chick and mouse tissue, as well as in primary cultures of chick cardiac and skeletal myocytes. Lasp-2 mRNA was detected as early as chick embryonic stage 25 and lasp-2 protein was associated with developing premyofibril structures, Z-discs of mature myofibrils, focal adhesions, and intercalated discs of cultured cardiomyocytes. Expression of GFP-tagged lasp-2 deletion constructs showed that the C-terminal region of lasp-2 is important for its localization in striated muscle cells. Lasp-2 organizes actin filaments into bundles and interacts directly with the Z-disc protein alpha-actinin. These results are consistent with a function of lasp-2 as a scaffolding and actin filament organizing protein within striated muscle Z-discs.},

oteins contains other domains that are essential for their cellular targeting and functions. The serine-rich linker region of nebulette has p

This article reviews the evidence implicating nebulin as a thin filament ruler, including the most recent studies highlighting its potentially extensive isoform diversity and exciting reports revealing its expression in cardiac tissue. Also examined are novel findings indicating that nebulin is actually a multifunctional filament system, perhaps playing roles in signal transduction, contractile regulation, and myofibril force generation; these ideas are especially intriguing given the growing number of mutations in this giant molecule that are associated with human myopathies.},

ebulette, is expressed in non-muscle cells. It displays a modular structure with an N-terminal LIM domain, three nebulin-like repeats, and a 
C-terminal SH3 domain and shows high similarity to another cytoskeletal protein, Lasp-1 (LIM and SH3 protein-1). Co-precipitation studies and
 results obtained with the two-hybrid system demonstrate that LIM-nebulette and Lasp-1 interact specifically with zyxin. Moreover, the SH3 do
main from LIM-nebulette is both necessary and sufficient for zyxin binding. The SH3 domains from Lasp-1 and nebulin can also interact with zy
xin, but the SH3 domains from more distantly related proteins such as vinexin and sorting nexin 9 do not. On the other hand, the binding site
 in zyxin is situated at the extreme N terminus as shown by site-directed mutagenesis. LIM-nebulette and Lasp-1 use the same linear binding m
otif. This motif shows some similarity to a class II binding site but does not contain the classical PXXP sequence. LIM-nebulette reveals a s

disease and gene evolution. To understand their organization within
the human genome, we have developed the computational tools and
methods necessary to detect identity between long stretches of
genomic sequence despite the presence of high copy repeats and
large insertion-deletions. Here we present our analysis of the
most recent genome assembly (January 2001) in which we focus on
the global organization of these segments and the role they play
in the whole-genome assembly process. Initially, we considered
only large recent duplication events that fell well-below levels
of draft sequencing error (alignments 90\%-98\% similar and >
or =1 kb in length). Duplications (90\%-98\%; > or =1 kb) comprise
3.6\% of all human sequence. These duplications show clustering
and up to 10-fold enrichment within pericentromeric and subtelomeric
regions. In terms of assembly, duplicated sequences were found
to be over-represented in unordered and unassigned contigs indicating
that duplicated sequences are difficult to assign to their proper
position. To assess coverage of these regions within the genome,
we selected BACs containing interchromosomal duplications and
characterized their duplication pattern by FISH. Only 47\% (106/224)
of chromosomes positive by FISH had a corresponding chromosomal
position by comparison. We present data that indicate that this
is attributable to misassembly, misassignment, and/or decreased
sequencing coverage within duplicated regions. Surprisingly, if
we consider putative duplications >98\% identity, we identify
10.6\% (286 Mb) of the current assembly as paralogous. The majority
of these alignments, we believe, represent unmerged overlaps within
unique regions. Taken together the above data indicate that segmental
duplications represent a significant impediment to accurate human
genome assembly, requiring the development of specialized techniques
to finish these exceptional regions of the genome. The identification
and characterization of these highly duplicated regions represents
an important step in the complete sequencing of a human reference
genome.}

binds to actin and the size of nebulin correlates with actin filament

thin filaments during myofibrillogenesis. We have previously described
the genomic organization of the 3' end of the nebulin gene (NEB),
and identified 18 different NEB mutations in patients with autosomal
recessive nemaline myopathy. Here we present the genomic organization
of the entire nebulin gene, and the identification of numerous
alternatively spliced mRNAs. The gene comprises 183 exons spanning
249 kb of the genomic sequence. The translation initiation codon
is in exon 3, and the stop codon and the 3' UTR are in exon 183.
There are four regions with alternatively spliced exons, that
is, exons 63-66, 82-105, 143-144 and 166-177, giving rise to a
number of different transcripts. The alternatively spliced exons
143-144 give rise to two different transcripts varying between
muscle types and between muscles of different developmental stages.
The alternatively spliced exons 166-177 express at least 20 different
transcripts in adult human tibialis anterior muscle alone. Preliminary
results show several transcripts in both of the two remaining
alternatively spliced regions. Extensive alternative splicing
of NEB may explain why nemaline myopathy patients with homozygous
truncating mutations show expression of the carboxy-terminus of
the nebulin protein contrary to expectations. The use of alternative
transcripts might also explain why severe phenotypes are rare
among patients with two truncating mutations.}

Stoichiometric analysis of nebulin fragment-induced actin polymerization

superrepeat influences multiple actin molecules along the F-actin
filament, consistent with a combination of strong and weak interactions
of nebulin over the length of the actin filament. The mechanisms
by which human nebulin fragments affect the interaction between
actin and myosin S1 are studied by fluorescence quenching, polarization,
and resonance energy transfer. We show that, under strong binding
conditions, premixing actin with the NA3 prior to adding myosin
subfragment 1 (S1) inhibits the rate of actoS1 association. The
nebulin fragments, NA3 and NA4, caused little effect on the extent
of actoS1 binding at equilibrium but did alter the nature of the
complex as evidenced by an increase in the resonance energy transfer
efficiencies between S1 and actin in the absence of ATP. The addition
of low concentrations of ATP rapidly dissociates the strong-binding
actoS1 irrespective of the presence or absence of nebulin fragment.
Interestingly, the strongly bound state reforms rapidly after
S1 hydrolyzes all available ATP. These observations are consistent
with the notion that nebulin might contribute to optimizing the
alignment of actomyosin interactions and inhibit suboptimal actomyosin
contacts.}

of the GFP linker and SH3 results in loss of the endogenous nebulette

Cells expressing either of these domains have dramatically reduced
beating frequencies, consistent with the loss of thin filament
proteins. This loss was inhibited by the addition of protease
inhibitors during culturing. The GFP repeat domain disrupts both
myofibrillogenesis and contraction in spreading cardiomyocytes,
whereas introduction of this protein into well-spread cardiomyocytes
results in localization at the Z-line and a 50\% reduction in
beating frequency. Ultimately, these cells form bundles containing
the GFP repeat and many myofilament proteins. Interestingly, butanedione
monoxime inhibition of contraction inhibited the formation of
these bundles. These results show that the GFP-nebulette domains

the skeletal muscle of vertebrates, has been suggested to be involved
in the length regulation of the thin filament as a 'molecular
ruler'. Despite its size, nebulin appears to be composed mainly
of small repeats of approximately 35 amino acids. We have characterized
in this study the conformational and functional properties of
single repeats. Complete repeats were found to bind to F-actin
while a truncated one did not. One repeat is therefore the smallest
unit for nebulin--actin interaction. Circular dichroism and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectra measured for the peptides in water
indicated a transient helical conformation. The folded region
is located for them all around the conserved sequence SDxxYK.
The helical conformation is strongly stabilized by anionic detergents
and trifluoroethanol while uncharged or positively charged detergents
have no effect. Since the surface of the actin filament is known
to contain clusters of negative charges, anionic detergents may
mimic the effect of an actin environment. 3D structures were calculated
for three representative peptides in SDS. In vivo, the nebulin
helices should form a complex with the actin filament. Based on
the assumed importance of charge interactions between nebulin
and actin, we propose a model for the structure of the F-actin-nebulin
complex in vivo. According to that, two nebulin molecules occupy
symmetrical positions along the central cleft of the actin filament
bridging the two strands of the actin two-start helix. The consistency
of this model with experimental data is discussed.}

It has been hypothesized that nebulin, a giant filamentous protein extending along the entire length of the thin filament, provides a blueprint for muscle thin filament assembly. To test this hypothesis, we generated a KO mouse model to investigate nebulin functions in vivo. Nebulin KO mice assemble thin filaments of reduced lengths and approximately 15\% of their Z-disks are abnormally wide. Our data demonstrate that nebulin functions in vivo as a molecular ruler by specifying pointed- and barbed-end thin filament capping. Consistent with the shorter thin filament length of nebulin deficient mice, maximal active tension was significantly reduced in KO animals. Phenotypically, the murine model recapitulates human nemaline myopathy (NM), that is, the formation of nemaline rods combined with severe skeletal muscle weakness. The myopathic changes in the nebulin KO model include depressed contractility, loss of myopalladin from the Z-disk, and dysregulation of genes involved in calcium homeostasis and glycogen metabolism; features potentially relevant for understanding human NM.}

Here, we report that CapZ specifically interacts with the C terminus of nebulin (modules 160-164) in blot overlay, solid-phase binding, tryptophan fluorescence, and SPOTs membrane assays. Binding of nebulin modules 160-164 to CapZ does not affect the ability of CapZ to cap actin filaments in vitro, consistent with our observation that neither of the two C-terminal actin binding regions of CapZ is necessary for its interaction with nebulin. Knockdown of nebulin in chick skeletal myotubes using small interfering RNA results in a reduction of assembled CapZ, and, strikingly, a loss of the uniform alignment of the barbed ends of the actin filaments. These data suggest that nebulin restricts the position of thin filament barbed ends to the Z-disc via a direct interaction with CapZ. We propose a novel molecular model of Z-disc architecture in which nebulin interacts with CapZ from a thin filament of an adjacent sarcomere, thus providing a structural link between sarcomeres.}

examining sequence features at the junctions of duplications.
We analyzed 9,464 junctions within regions of high-quality finished
sequence from a genomewide set of 2,366 duplication alignments.
We observed a highly significant (P<.0001) enrichment of Alu short
interspersed element (SINE) sequences near or within the junction.
Twenty-seven percent of all segmental duplications terminated
within an Alu repeat. The Alu junction enrichment was most pronounced
for interspersed segmental duplications separated by > or =1 Mb
of intervening sequence. Alu elements at the junctions showed
higher levels of divergence, consistent with Alu-Alu-mediated
recombination events. When we classified Alu elements into major
subfamilies, younger elements (AluY and AluS) accounted for the
enrichment, whereas the oldest primate family (AluJ) showed no
enrichment. We propose that the primate-specific burst of Alu
retroposition activity (which occurred 35-40 million years ago)
sensitized the ancestral human genome for Alu-Alu-mediated recombination
events, which, in turn, initiated the expansion of gene-rich segmental
duplications and their subsequent role in nonallelic homologous
recombination.}

CNV regions observed in multiple individuals exhibited genomic
architectural complexity in the form of smaller CNVs within larger

abstract = {Incorrect folding of proteins, leading to aggregation and amyloid formation, is associated with a group of highly debilitating medical conditions including Alzheimer's disease and late-onset diabetes. The issue of how unwanted protein association is normally avoided in a living system is particularly significant in the context of the evolution of multidomain proteins, which account for over 70\% of all eukaryotic proteins, where the effective local protein concentration in the vicinity of each domain is very high. Here we describe the aggregation kinetics of multidomain protein constructs of immunoglobulin domains and the ability of different homologous domains to aggregate together. We show that aggregation of these proteins is a specific process and that the efficiency of coaggregation between different domains decreases markedly with decreasing sequence identity. Thus, whereas immunoglobulin domains with more than about 70\% identity are highly prone to coaggregation, those with less than 30-40\% sequence identity do not detectably interact. A bioinformatics analysis of consecutive homologous domains in large multidomain proteins shows that such domains almost exclusively have sequence identities of less than 40\%, in other words below the level at which coaggregation is likely to be efficient. We propose that such low sequence identities could have a crucial and general role in safeguarding proteins against misfolding and aggregation.},

abstract = {'BLAST 2 Sequences', a new BLAST-based tool for aligning two protein or nucleotide sequences, is described. While the standard BLAST program is widely used to search for homologous sequences in nucleotide and protein databases, one often needs to compare only two sequences that are already known to be homologous, coming from related species or, e.g. different isolates of the same virus. In such cases searching the entire database would be unnecessarily time-consuming. 'BLAST 2 Sequences' utilizes the BLAST algorithm for pairwise DNA-DNA or protein-protein sequence comparison. A World Wide Web version of the program can be used interactively at the NCBI WWW site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/bl2.++ +html). The resulting alignments are presented in both graphical and text form. The variants of the program for PC (Windows), Mac and several UNIX-based platforms can be downloaded from the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).},

abstract = {The amino acid sequence of the adenovirus fibre protein reveals an approximately repeating motif of 15 residues. A diagonal comparison matrix established that these repeats extended from residue 43 to residue 400 of the 581 residue sequence. Assignment of secondary structure combined with model building showed that each 15-residue segment contained two short beta-strands and two beta-bends, one of which incorporated an extra residue in a beta-bulge of the Gx type. The 44 strands together gave a long (210 A) narrow, amphipathic beta-sheet, which could be stabilised by dimer formation to give the shaft of the fibre. The knob could arise from a dimer of the C-terminal 180 residue segment, predicted to be an 8-10 stranded beta-sandwich. This model is consistent with the electron micrographs of the fibre and it was supported by measurements of c.d. and of electron diffraction from microcrystals. The latter gave a pair of wide angle arcs, corresponding to a repeat of 4.7 A, oriented appropriately for a cross-beta structure. The relation of this structure to globular structures is discussed and a folding pathway is proposed. In its general features the structure resembles that proposed for the tail fibre of bacteriophage T4.},

A new gene, 1715, isolated using cloned trapped exons from the target area contains a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on HD chromosomes. A (CAG)n repeat longer than the normal range was observed on HD chromosomes from all 75 disease families examined, comprising a variety of ethnic backgrounds and 4p 16.3 haplotypes. The (CAG)n repeat appears to be located within the coding sequence of a predicted â348 kd protein that is widely expressed but unrelated to any known gene. Thus, the HD mutation involves an unstable DNA segment, similar to those described in fragile X syndrome, spino-bulbar muscular atrophy, and myotonic dystrophy, acting in the context of a novel 4p16.3 gene to produce a dominant phenotype.},

Their presence in functionally diverse proteins such as enzymes, toxins, and transcription factors strongly suggests domain shuffling, but their occurrence in prokaryotes and yeast excludes exon shuffling. The spreading mechanism remains unknown, but in at least three cases horizontal gene transfer appears to be involved. ANK repeats occur in at least four consecutive copies. The terminal repeats are more variable in sequence. One feature of the internal repeats is a predicted central hydrophobic alpha-helix, which is likely to interact with other repeats. The functions of the ankyrin-like repeats are compatible with a role in protein-protein interactions.},

The latter is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine repeat within the N-terminal domain of the receptor. Thus the androgen receptor is one of a growing number of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins, including huntingtin (Huntington's disease), ataxin-1 (spinocerebellar ataxia, type 1) and ataxin-3 (spinocerebellar ataxia, type 3), which show expansion of CAG triplet repeats. Although widely studied, the functions of huntingtin, ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 remain unknown.

Its molecules are string-like and in vivo span from the M to Z-lines. I-band regions of titin are thought to make elastic connections between the thick filament and the Z-line, thereby forming a third type of sarcomere filament. These would centre the A-band in the sarcomere and provide structural continuity in relaxed myofibrils. The A-band region of titin seems to be bound to the thick filament, where it has been proposed to act as a 'molecular ruler' regulating filament length and assembly. Here, we show that partial titin complementary DNAs encode a regular pattern of two types of 100-residue motif, each of which probably folds into a separate domain type. Such motifs are present in several evolutionarily divergent muscle proteins, all of which are likely to interact with myosin. One or both of the domain types is therefore likely to bind to myosin.},

Invariant germ line-encoded, LRR-containing proteins are pivotal mediators of microbial recognition throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. Whereas the genomes of plants and deuterostome and chordate invertebrates harbor large arsenals of recognition receptors primarily encoding LRR-containing proteins, relatively few innate pattern recognition receptors suffice for survival of pathogen-infected nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. The appearance of a lymphocyte-based recombinatorial system of anticipatory immunity in the vertebrates may have been driven by a need to facilitate developmental and morphological plasticity in addition to the advantage conferred by the ability to recognize a larger portion of the antigenic world.},

abstract = {Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins, with 564 members in the human genome, probably constitute the largest individual family of transcription factors in mammals. Approximately 30\% of these proteins carry a potent repressor domain called the Kruppel associated box (KRAB). Depending on the structure of the KRAB domain, these proteins have been further divided into three subfamilies (A + B, A + b, and A only). In addition, some KRAB zinc finger proteins contain another conserved motif called SCAN. To study their molecular evolution, an extensive comparative analysis of a large panel of KRAB zinc finger genes was performed. The results show that both the KRAB A + b and the KRAB A subfamilies have their origin in a single member or a few closely related members of the KRA>B A + B family. The KRAB A + B family is also the most prevalent among the KRAB zinc finger genes. Furthermore, we show that internal duplications of individual zinc finger motifs or blocks of several zinc finger motifs have occurred quite frequently within this gene family. However, zinc finger motifs are also frequently lost from the open reading frame, either by functional inactivation by point mutations or by the introduction of a stop codon. The introduction of a stop codon causes the exclusion of part of the zinc finger region from the coding region and the formation of graveyards of degenerate zinc finger motifs in the 3'-untranslated region of these genes. Earlier reports have shown that duplications of zinc finger genes commonly occur throughout evolution. We show that there is a relatively low degree of sequence conservation of the zinc finger motifs after these duplications. In many cases this may cause altered binding specificities of the transcription factors encoded by these genes. The repetitive nature of the zinc finger region and the structural flexibility within the zinc finger motif make these proteins highly adaptable. These factors may have been of major importance for their massive expansion in both number and complexity during metazoan evolution.},

abstract = {Protein interaction networks display approximate scale-free topology, in which hub proteins that interact with a large number of other proteins determine the overall organization of the network. In this study, we aim to determine whether hubs are distinguishable from other networked proteins by specific sequence features. Proteins of different connectednesses were compared in the interaction networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Homo sapienswith respect to the distribution of predicted structural disorder, sequence repeats, low complexity regions, and chain length. Highly connected proteins ("hub proteins") contained significantly more of, and greater proportion of, these sequence features and tended to be longer overall as compared to less connected proteins. These sequence features provide two different functional means for realizing multiple interactions: (1) extended interaction surface and (2) flexibility and adaptability, providing a mechanism for the same region to bind distinct partners. Our view contradicts the prevailing view that scaling in protein interactomes arose from gene duplication and preferential attachment of equivalent proteins. We propose an alternative evolutionary network specialization process, in which certain components of the protein interactome improved their fitness for binding by becoming longer or accruing regions of disorder and/or internal repeats and have therefore become specialized in network organization.},

abstract = {Internal symmetry in proteins is likely to be the footprint of evolution by gene duplication and fusion. Like other symmetrical proteins, $\beta$-propellers, which are made of 4-10 $\beta$-sheet units (blades) circularly arranged around a central tunnel, have probably evolved by duplication and fusion of a rudimentary repetitive unit. However, reproducing the evolution of functional $\beta$-propellers by duplication and fusion of repeated units remains a challenge, in particular, because the repeated units must jointly pack to form one hydrophobic core while maintaining intact active sites. As model for generating repeat propellers, we chose tachylectin-2--a highly symmetrical five-bladed $\beta$-propeller lectin with five sugar-binding sites. We report the engineering of folded and functional lectins by duplication and fusion of repetitive sequence modules taken from tachylectin-2. The repeated modules comprise three strands of one blade plus one strand of the next blade, thus enabling the closure of the propeller's ring via strand-strand Velcro-like interactions. Duplication and fusion of five modules with the same sequence gave rise to a highly aggregated protein, yet its soluble fraction exhibited lectin function. Subsequently, a library of diversified sequence modules fused in tandem was selected by phage display for glycoprotein binding. A range of new lectins were isolated with binding and biophysical properties that resemble those of wild-type tachylectin-2. These results demonstrate the ability to construct folded and functional globular repeat proteins, and support the role of duplication and fusion of elementary modules in the evolutionary routes that led to the $\beta$-propellers fold.},

Deregulation of this balance leads to pathophysiological states that drive diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. The recent discovery of the PHLPP (pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase) family of Ser/Thr phosphatases adds a new player to the cast of phosphate-controlling enzymes in cell signaling. PHLPP isozymes catalyze the dephosphorylation of a conserved regulatory motif, the hydrophobic motif, on the AGC kinases Akt, PKC, and S6 kinase, as well as an inhibitory site on the kinase Mst1, to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis. The frequent deletion of PHLPP in cancer, coupled with the development of prostate tumors in mice lacking PHLPP1, identifies PHLPP as a novel tumor suppressor. This minireview discusses the structure, function, and regulation of PHLPP, with particular focus on its role in disease.},

The hallmark pathological features of PD are loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra and neuronal intracellular Lewy body inclusions. Parkinsonism is typically sporadic in nature; however, several rare familial forms are linked to genetic loci, and the identification of causal mutations has provided insight into the disease process. PARK8, identified in 2002 by Funayama and colleagues, appears to be a common cause of familial PD. We describe here the cloning of a novel gene that contains missense mutations segregating with PARK8-linked PD in five families from England and Spain. Because of the tremor observed in PD and because a number of the families are of Basque descent, we have named this protein dardarin, derived from the Basque word dardara, meaning tremor.},

It belongs to the ROCO protein family and includes a protein kinase domain of the MAPKKK class and several other major functional domains. Within affected carriers of families A and D, six post mortem diagnoses reveal brainstem dopaminergic degeneration accompanied by strikingly diverse pathologies. These include abnormalities consistent with Lewy body Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, nigral degeneration without distinctive histopathology, and progressive supranuclear palsy-like pathology. Clinical diagnoses of Parkinsonism with dementia or amyotrophy or both, with their associated pathologies, are also noted. Hence, LRRK2 may be central to the pathogenesis of several major neurodegenerative disorders associated with parkinsonism.},

The last few years have also been marked by an emergence of new 3D structures of these proteins. Appraisal of the known structures and their classification uncovers a straightforward relationship between their architecture and the length of the repetitive units. This relationship and the repetitive character of structural folds suggest rules for better prediction of the 3D structures of such proteins. Furthermore, bioinformatics approaches combined with low resolution structural data, from biophysical techniques, especially, the recently emerged cryo-electron microscopy, lead to reliable prediction of the protein repeat structures and their mode of binding with partners within molecular complexes. This hybrid approach can actively be used for structural and functional annotations of proteomes.},

Repeats 13-24 are especially active, with known sites of interaction for the Na/K ATPase, Cl/HCO(3) anion exchanger, voltage-gated sodium channel, clathrin heavy chain and L1 family cell adhesion molecules. Here we report the crystal structure of a human ankyrinR construct containing ANK repeats 13-24 and a portion of the spectrin-binding domain. The ANK repeats are observed to form a contiguous spiral stack with which the spectrin-binding domain fragment associates as an extended strand. The structural information has been used to construct models of all 24 repeats of the membrane-binding domain as well as the interactions of the repeats with the Cl/HCO(3) anion exchanger and clathrin. These models, together with available binding studies, suggest that ion transporters such as the anion exchanger associate in a large central cavity formed by the ANK repeat spiral, while clathrin and cell adhesion molecules associate with specific regions outside this cavity.},

abstract = {Recent studies on the genomes of protists, plants, fungi and animals confirm that the increase in genome size and gene number in different eukaryotic lineages is paralleled by a general decrease in genome compactness and an increase in the number and size of introns. It may thus be predicted that exon-shuffling has become increasingly significant with the evolution of larger, less compact genomes. To test the validity of this prediction, we have analyzed the evolutionary distribution of modular proteins that have clearly evolved by intronic recombination. The results of this analysis indicate that modular multidomain proteins produced by exon-shuffling are restricted in their evolutionary distribution. Although such proteins are present in all major groups of metazoa from sponges to chordates, there is practically no evidence for the presence of related modular proteins in other groups of eukaryotes. The biological significance of this difference in the composition of the proteomes of animals, fungi, plants and protists is best appreciated when these modular proteins are classified with respect to their biological function. The majority of these proteins can be assigned to functional categories that are inextricably linked to multicellularity of animals, and are of absolute importance in permitting animals to function in an integrated fashion: constituents of the extracellular matrix, proteases involved in tissue remodelling processes, various proteins of body fluids, membrane-associated proteins mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, membrane associated receptor proteins regulating cell cell communications, etc. Although some basic types of modular proteins seem to be shared by all major groups of metazoa, there are also groups of modular proteins that appear to be restricted to certain evolutionary lineages. In summary, the results suggest that exon-shuffling acquired major significance at the time of metazoan radiation. It is interesting to note that the rise of exon-shuffling coincides with a spectacular burst of evolutionary creativity: the Big Bang of metazoan radiation. It seems probable that modular protein evolution by exon-shuffling has contributed significantly to this accelerated evolution of metazoa, since it facilitated the rapid construction of multidomain extracellular and cell surface proteins that are indispensable for multicellularity.},

Here we report a 2.0 A resolution crystal structure for the hRI-Ang complex that, together with extensive mutagenesis data from earlier studies, reveals the molecular features of this tight interaction. The hRI-Ang binding interface is large and encompasses 26 residues from hRI and 24 from Ang, recruited from multiple domains of both proteins. However, a substantial fraction of the energetically important contacts involve only a single region of each: the C-terminal segment 434-460 of hRI and the ribonucleolytic active centre of Ang, most notably the catalytic residue Lys40. Although the overall docking of Ang resembles that observed for RNase A in the crystal structure of its complex with the porcine RNase inhibitor, the vast majority of the interactions in the two complexes are distinctive, indicating that the broad specificity of the inhibitor for pancreatic RNase superfamily proteins is based largely on its capacity to recognize features unique to each of them. The implications of these findings for the development of small, hRI-based inhibitors of Ang for therapeutic use are discussed.},

abstract = {The vertebrate filamin family (A, B, and C) is part of the spectrin family of actin cross-linking proteins. Family members share high sequence similarity (>64\%) and have both common and isoform-distinct functionalities. To identify the basis for isoform-specific functionality, we perform an evolutionary trace of chordate filamin at the granularity of single residues. Our trace methodology is constrained to focus on neofunctionality by requiring that one isoform remain the ancestral type, whereas at least one isoform has an accepted mutation. We call divergence meeting these characteristics "class-distinctive." To obtain a temporal and spatial context for class-distinctive residues, we derive an all-atom model of full-length filamin A by homology modeling and joining individual domains. We map onto our model both conserved and class-distinctive residues along with the period (Teleostei, Amphibian, and Mammalian) in which they diverged. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that filamins diverged from a common ancestral gene between urochordate and vertebrate lineages. Filamins also diverged the most just after gene duplication, in the Teleostei period, with filamin C remaining closest to ancestral filamin. At the residue level, domains with well-characterized interfaces, IgFLN 17 and IgFLN 21 (immunoglobulin, Ig), have diverged in potentially critical residues in their adhesion protein-binding interfaces, signifying that isoforms may bind or regulate ligand binding differentially. Similarly, isoform divergence in a region associated with F actin-binding regulation suggests that isoforms differentially regulate F-actin binding. In addition, we observe some class-distinctive residues in the vicinity of missense mutations that cause filamin A and B-associated skeletal disorders. Our analysis, utilizing both spatial and temporal granularity, has identified potentially important residues responsible for vertebrate filamin isoform-specific divergence-significantly in regions where few binding partners have been discovered to date- and suggests yet to be discovered filamin-binding partners and isoform-specific differential regulation with these binding partners.},

Correlation between variables at two sites does not imply that
the two sites directly interact, because, e.g., correlation between
distant sites may be induced by chaining of correlation between
a set of intervening, directly interacting sites. Such "noncausal
correlation" is well understood in statistical physics: an example
is long-range order in spin systems, where spins which have only
short-range direct interactions, e.g., the Ising model, display
correlation at a  distance. It is less well recognized that such
long-range "noncausal" correlations can in fact be stronger than
the magnitude of any causal correlation induced by direct interactions.
We call this phenomenon superadditive correlation (SAC). We demonstrate
this counterintuitive phenomenon by explicit examples in (i) a
model spin system and (ii) a model continuous variable system,
where both models are such that two variables have multiple intervening
pathways of indirect interaction. We apply the technique known
as decimation to explain SAC as an additive, constructive interference
phenomenon between the multiple pathways of indirect interaction.
We also explain the effect using a definition of the collective
mode describing the intervening spin variables. Finally, we show
that  the SAC effect is mirrored in information theory, and is
true for mutual information measures in addition to correlation
measures. Generic complex systems typically exhibit multiple pathways
of indirect interaction, making SAC a potentially widespread phenomenon.
This affects, e.g., attempts to deduce interactions by examination
of correlations, as well as, e.g., hierarchical approximation
methods for multivariate probability distributions, which introduce
parameters based on successive orders of correlation.}

Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques

A variety of computational approaches based, for example,  on
sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles,
have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein
interactions (PPIs). Yet comparative studies suggest that the
development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still
in its early stages. Here we show that three-dimensional structural
information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage
that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence.
Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural
information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy
to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence
interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental
tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the
PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological
interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural

	formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes

	at the genome scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we detect translation
	of hundreds of short species-specific open reading frames (ORFs)

	provide adaptive potential, as suggested by their differential regulation
	upon stress and by signatures of retention by natural selection.
	In line with our model, we establish that S. cerevisiae ORFs can

We determine that codon usage values for most orphan genes fall within the bulk of the codon usage distribution of bona fide human proteins, supporting their current protein-coding annotation. We also show that primate orphan genes display distinctive features in relation to genes of wider phylogenetic distribution: higher tissue specificity, more rapid evolution, and shorter peptide size. We estimate that around 24\% are highly divergent members of mammalian protein families. Interestingly, around 53\% of the orphan genes contain sequences derived from transposable elements (TEs) and are mostly located in primate-specific genomic regions. This indicates frequent recruitment of TEs as part of novel genes.

number of identifications (not always unique to a single gene).
However, complications arise from incomplete or ambiguous characterization

acetylation and methylation) and endogenous protein cleavages,
especially when combinations of these create complex patterns
of intact protein isoforms and species. 'Top-down'  interrogation
of whole proteins can overcome these problems for individual proteins,
but has not been achieved on a proteome scale owing to the lack
of intact protein fractionation methods that are well integrated
with tandem mass spectrometry. Here we show, using a new four-dimensional
separation system, identification of 1,043 gene products from
human cells that are dispersed into more than 3,000 protein species
created by post-translational modification (PTM), RNA splicing
and proteolysis. The overall system produced greater than 20-fold
increases in both separation power and proteome coverage, enabling
the identification of proteins up to 105 kDa and those with up
to 11 transmembrane helices. Many previously undetected isoforms
of endogenous human proteins were mapped, including changes in
multiply modified species in response to accelerated cellular
ageing (senescence) induced by DNA damage. Integrated with the

protein disorder and exposed hydrophobic surface. We found that
strict rules govern the selection of alternative splice variants
aimed to preserve the integrity of globular domains:  alternative
splice sites (i) tend to avoid globular domains or (ii) affect
them only marginally or (iii) tend to coincide with a location
where the exposed hydrophobic surface is minimal or (iv) the protein
is disordered. We also observed an inverse correlation between
the domain fraction lost and the full length of the minor isoform

a novel machine learning approach for contact map prediction using
three steps of increasing resolution. First, we use 2D recursive
neural networks to predict coarse contacts and orientations between
secondary structure elements. Second, we use an energy-based method
to align secondary structure elements and predict contact probabilities
between residues in contacting alpha-helices or strands. Third,
we use a deep neural network architecture to organize and progressively
refine the prediction of contacts, integrating information over
both space and time. We train the architecture on a large set
of non-redundant proteins and test it on a large set of non-homologous
domains, as well as on the set of protein domains used for contact
prediction in the two most recent CASP8 and CASP9 experiments.
For long-range contacts, the accuracy of the new CMAPpro predictor
is close to 30\%, a significant increase over existing approaches.

been developed, based on different algorithms and using various
kinds of information. To examine  the performance of these methods
several evaluation experiments have been conducted. These include
blind tests in CASP/CAFASP, large scale benchmarks, and  long-term,
continuous assessment with newly solved protein structures. These
studies confirm the expectation that for different targets different
methods produce the best predictions, and the final prediction
accuracy could be improved if the available methods were combined
in a perfect manner. In this article a neural-network-based consensus
predictor, Pcons, is presented that attempts this  task. Pcons
attempts to select the best model out of those produced by six
prediction servers, each using different methods. Pcons translates
the confidence scores reported by each server into uniformly scaled
values corresponding to the  expected accuracy of each model.
The translated scores as well as the similarity  between models
produced by different servers is used in the final selection.
According to the analysis based on two unrelated sets of newly
solved proteins, Pcons outperforms any single server by generating
approximately 8\%-10\% more correct predictions. Furthermore,
the specificity of Pcons is significantly higher than for any
individual server. From analyzing different input data to Pcons
it can be shown that the improvement is mainly attributable to
measurement  of the similarity between the different models. Pcons

replication, however, generates somatic mutations. Consequently,
multicellular organisms comprise mosaics where most cells acquire
unique genomes  that are potentially capable of delineating their

embryonic relationships by deducing the order in which mutations
have arisen during development. We show that polyguanine repeat
DNA sequences are particularly useful genetic markers, because
they frequently change length during mitosis. To demonstrate feasibility,
we phylogenetically reconstruct the lineage of cultured mouse
NIH 3T3 cells based on mutations affecting the length of polyguanine
markers. We then employ whole genome amplification to genotype
polyguanine markers in single cells taken from a mouse and use
phylogenetics to infer the developmental relationships of the
sampled tissues. The result is consistent with the present understanding
of embryogenesis and demonstrates the large scale potential of
this method for producing a complete mammalian cell fate at the

genes consist of proteins exposed on or secreted from  the cell

cellular  functions that are defective in cancers, the data provide
candidates for follow-up studies to investigate their functional

more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are

We have previously described a computational approach, called
Retracing the Evolutionary Steps in Cancer (RESIC), to determine
the temporal sequence of genetic alterations during tumorigenesis
from cross-sectional genomic data of tumors at their fully transformed
stage. Since alterations within a set of genes belonging to a
particular signaling pathway may have similar or equivalent effects,
we applied a pathway-based systems biology approach to the RESIC
methodology. This method was  used to determine whether alterations
of specific pathways develop early or late  during malignant transformation.
When applied to primary glioblastoma (GBM) copy  number data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, RESIC identified a temporal
order of pathway alterations consistent with the order of events
in secondary GBMs. We then further subdivided the samples into
the four main GBM subtypes and determined the relative contributions
of each subtype to the overall results: we found that the overall
ordering applied for the proneural subtype but differed for mesenchymal
samples. The temporal sequence of events could not be identified
for neural and classical subtypes, possibly due to a limited number
of samples. Moreover, for samples of the proneural subtype, we
detected two distinct temporal sequences of events: (i) RAS pathway
activation was followed by TP53 inactivation and finally PI3K2
activation, and (ii) RAS activation preceded only  AKT activation.
This extension of the RESIC methodology provides an evolutionary
mathematical approach to identify the temporal sequence of pathway
changes driving tumorigenesis and may be useful in guiding the
understanding of signaling rearrangements in cancer development.}

order in which mutations occur is poorly understood. Inference
of a temporal ordering on the level of genes is challenging because
clinically and histologically identical tumors often have few
mutated genes in common. This heterogeneity may at least in part
be due to mutations in different genes having similar phenotypic
effects by  acting in the same functional pathway. We estimate
the constraints on the order in which alterations accumulate during
cancer progression from cross-sectional mutation data using a
probabilistic graphical model termed Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian
Network (H-CBN). The possible orders are analyzed on the level
of genes  and, after mapping genes to functional pathways, also
on the pathway level. We find stronger evidence for pathway order
constraints than for gene order constraints, indicating that temporal
ordering results from selective pressure acting at the pathway
level. The accumulation of changes in core pathways differs among
cancer types, yet a common feature is that progression appears
to begin with mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis pathways
and to conclude with mutations in genes involved in invasion pathways.
H-CBN models provide a quantitative and intuitive model of tumorigenesis
showing that the genetic events can be linked to the phenotypic
progression on the level of pathways.}

(SPP) to study the clonal composition of breast tumors. SPP involves
macro-dissecting tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by
DNA  content, and profiling genomes using comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH). Breast carcinomas display two classes of
genomic structural variation: (1) monogenomic and (2) polygenomic.
Monogenomic tumors appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation
with a highly stable chromosome structure. Polygenomic tumors
contain multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which may occupy
the same sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic
tumors, we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to a few clonal
subpopulations, rather than a series of gradual intermediates.
By comparing multiple subpopulations from different anatomic locations,
we have inferred pathways of cancer progression and the organization

that the usage of thermolysin, an enzyme working at the natural

we detect a similar number of peptides and proteins using thermolysin

the same environmental condition show substantial variability
in gene expression profiles. Although single-cell RNA-seq provides
an opportunity to explore this phenomenon,  statistical methods
need to be developed to interpret the variability of gene expression
counts. RESULTS: We develop a statistical framework for studying
the kinetics of stochastic gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq
data. By applying our model to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset generated
by profiling mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the inferred
kinetic parameters are consistent with RNA  polymerase II binding
and chromatin modifications. Our results suggest that histone
modifications affect transcriptional bursting by modulating both
burst size and frequency. Furthermore, we show that our model
can be used to identify genes with slow promoter kinetics, which
are important for probabilistic differentiation of embryonic stem
cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the proposed statistical
model provides a flexible and efficient way to investigate the
kinetics of transcription.}

allowing only pairwise dependencies and partition aberrations
into modules, in which all aberrations are restricted to have
the same dependencies, we reduce the number of parameters so that
datasets sizes relevant to cancer applications can be handled.
We apply our framework to a dataset of colorectal cancer tumor
karyotypes. The obtained model explains the data significantly
better than a model where independence between the aberrations
is assumed. In fact, the obtained model performs very well with
respect to several measures of goodness of fit and is, with respect

proteomics data. The absence of these genes in  chimp and macaque

the same disabling sequence difference, supporting the inference
that the ancestral sequence was noncoding over the alternative
possibility of parallel gene inactivation in multiple primate
lineages. The genes are not well characterized,  but interestingly,
one of them was first identified as an up-regulated gene in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. This is the first evidence for entirely
novel human-specific protein-coding genes originating from ancestrally

originate is by modification of pre-existing genes, e.g. by duplication
or horizontal transfer. In contrast, many viruses generate protein-coding
genes de novo, via the overprinting of a new reading frame onto
an existing ("ancestral") frame. This mechanism is thought to
play an important role in viral pathogenicity, but has been poorly
explored, perhaps because identifying the de novo frames is very
challenging. Therefore, a new approach to detect them was needed.
We assembled a  reference set of overlapping genes for which we
could reliably determine the ancestral frames, and found that
their codon usage was significantly closer to that of the rest
of the viral genome than the codon usage of de novo frames. Based
on this observation, we designed a method that allowed the identification
of de novo frames based on their codon usage with a very good
specificity, but intermediate sensitivity. Using our method, we
predicted that the Rex gene of deltaretroviruses has originated
de novo by overprinting the Tax gene. Intriguingly, several genes
in the same genomic region have also originated de novo and encode
proteins that regulate the functions of Tax. Such "gene nurseries"
may be common in viral genomes. Finally, our results confirm that
the  genomic GC content is not the only determinant of codon usage
in viruses and suggest that a constraint linked to translation

the evolutionary forces responsible for this pattern remain obscure.
Here, we classify human-chimp protein-coding genes into different

We estimate the strength of purifying selection and the rate of
adaptive selection for genes in different age classes. We find
that older genes carry fewer and less frequent nonsynonymous single-nucleotide
polymorphisms than younger genes suggesting that  older genes
experience a stronger purifying selection at the protein-coding
level. We infer the distribution of fitness effects of new deleterious
mutations  and find that older genes have proportionally more
slightly deleterious mutations and fewer nearly neutral mutations
than younger genes. To investigate the role of adaptive selection
of genes in different age classes, we determine the selection
coefficient (gamma = 2N(e)s) of genes using the MKPRF approach
and estimate the ratio of the rate of adaptive nonsynonymous substitution
to synonymous substitution (omega(A)) using the DoFE method. Although
the proportion of positively selected genes (gamma > 0) is significantly
higher in younger genes, we find no correlation between omega(A)

that younger genes are subject to weaker purifying selection and
more tenuous evidence that they also undergo adaptive evolution

and their structural maturation shows such a continuum by analyzing
their changes with gene age. I show that 1) The number of regulatory,
protein-protein, and genetic interactions increases continuously
with gene age, although with very different rates. New regulatory
interactions emerge rapidly within a few million years, while
the number of protein-protein and genetic interactions increases
slowly, with a rate of 2-2.25 x 10(-8)/year and 4.8 x 10(-8)/year,
respectively. 2) Gene essentiality evolves relatively quickly:
the youngest essential genes appear in proto-genes approximately
14 MY old. 3) In contrast to interactions, the secondary structure
of proteins and their robustness to mutations indicate that new
genes face a bottleneck in their evolution: proto-genes are characterized
by high beta-strand content, high aggregation propensity, and
low robustness against mutations, while conserved genes are characterized
by lower strand content and higher stability, most likely due
to the higher probability of gene loss among young genes and accumulation

the difficulty involved in correctly aligning such sequences.
Here, we circumvent this problem by first only analyzing homologous
proteins based on length variation rather than pairwise alignments.
Using this approach, we find a surprisingly strong relationship
between difference in length and difference in the number of intrinsically
disordered residues, where up to three  quarters of the length
variation can be explained by changes in the number of intrinsically
disordered residues. Further, we find that disorder is common
in both insertions and deletions. A more detailed analysis reveals
that indel events do not induce disorder but rather that already
disordered regions accrue indels,  suggesting that there is a
lowered selective pressure for indels to occur within  intrinsically
disordered regions.}

(AT) gene (11q22-q23), the TP53 gene (17p13.1) and the androgen
receptor (AR) (Xq11.2-q12). These genes, however, differ dramatically
in terms of the risk of breast cancer that they confer, the proportion
of breast cancer incidence that they account for and the other
cancers and other phenotypes with which they are associated. Genetic
linkage studies have shown that some high risk breast cancer families,
particularly those where breast cancer occurs in association with
ovarian cancer, are due to a gene on chromosome 17q known as BRCA1.
The BRCA1 gene is estimated to confer a breast cancer risk of
about 70\% by age 70, and may account for about  2\% of overall
breast cancer incidence, although a higher proportion of younger
cases. Germline mutations in the TP53 gene are responsible for
a high proportion  of LI-Fraumeni families, in which breast cancer
occurs in association with childhood sarcomas and other cancers.
In such families, the risk of breast cancer is over 50\% by age
50, and the risk of all cancers is nearly 100\%; germline TP53
mutations are, however, probably responsible for much less than
1\% of all breast  cancer. By contrast, heterozygotes for the
AT gene carry a much more moderate risk of breast cancer. This
gene, however, is much more common in the population  and may
account for 7\% or more of breast cancer incidence. Finally, germline
mutations in the androgen receptor are known to cause male breast
cancer, but this has only been demonstrated in two families. Evidence
from linkage and population based studies suggests that these
genes may account for about one half of the observed familial
clustering of breast cancer; other breast cancer susceptibility
genes therefore remain to be identified.}

identification of BRCA1 and the localization of BRCA2 lend urgency
to the  need to assess breast cancer intervention and prevention
strategies for women likely to carry germline mutations at these
loci. At present, families with a history consistent with a BRCA1
or BRCA2 mutation should be tested within the confines of a research
protocol and encouraged to participate in intervention and prevention
trials. Both retrospective studies and prospective clinical trials
are critically needed. While randomized clinical trials would
be the optimal mechanism to assess the relative efficacy of these
potential interventions, no consensus was obtained as to whether
such a trial would be feasible because of strong patient preference
for intervention type. It is likely that optimal intervention
and prevention strategies will consist of a combined approach
to risk reduction. Participants must be appropriately informed

testing. The potential risks of testing for genetic susceptibility
include not only potential psychosocial harm that may result from

is prevalent among vertebrates. Given that protein domains are
defined as structurally, functionally and evolutionarily distinct

a number of different domain architectures from  one gene template.
However, recent findings indicate that smaller alternative splicing
events, in particular in disordered regions, might be more prominent
than domain architectural changes. The problem of identifying
protein isoforms is, however, still not resolved. Clearly, many

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely
useful tool for molecular and evolutionary biology and there are
several programs and algorithms  available for this purpose. Although
previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different
MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not
been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount
of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms,
and increasing demand for  large-scale data analysis, it is imperative
to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance
between alignment accuracy and computational cost  has become
a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared
both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW,
CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons
and T-Coffee, against  the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE
and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in
each program's algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated
with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE,
the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs
were determined by  collecting peak memory usage and time of execution.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based
programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed
the other programs in accuracy. Whenever sequences with large
N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE suite, Probalign,
MAFFT and  also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee.
The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy
and slower than POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW
and MUSCLE were the fastest programs, being CLUSTALW the least
RAM memory demanding program. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results
presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign
and MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple
sequence alignments. T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can
deliver faster and reliable alignments, which are specially suited
for larger datasets than those encountered in the BAliBASE suite,
if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization
of alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed
by more programs in a near future, which will certainly improve
performance significantly.}

an effort to reduce search time. Using this heuristic, we obtain
a 20-fold decrease in Forward and a 6-fold decrease in Viterbi
search time with a minimal loss in sensitivity relative to the
unfiltered approaches. We then implemented an iterative profile-HMM

Due to our search heuristic, we eliminated the subdatabase creation
that is common in current iterative profile-HMM approaches. On
our benchmark, JackHMMER detects 14\% more remote protein homologs
than SAM's iterative method T2K. CONCLUSIONS: Our search heuristic,
HMMERHEAD, significantly reduces the time needed to score a profile-HMM

us to implement an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER,

zone. This is done by successive stages of partial closure that
propagate the location of the chain break backwards along the
chain. At the end of these stages, the size of the chain break
is generally reduced so much that it can be repaired by adjusting
the position of a single atom. Our chain closure method is efficient
with a computational complexity of O(N(d)), where N(d) is the
number of degrees of freedom used to repair the chain break. The
new method facilitates the use of arbitrary degrees of freedom
including the "natural" degrees of freedom inferred  from analyzing
experimental (X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance
[NMR]) structures of nucleic acids and proteins. In terms of its
ability to generate large conformational moves and its effectiveness
in locating low energy  states, the new method is robust and computationally
efficient.}

simulation of protein folding by introducing "local moves" in
dihedral space. A local move consists of changes in backbone dihedral
angles in a sequential window while the  positions of all atoms
outside the window remain unchanged. We find three advantages
of local moves: (1) For some energy functions, protein conformations
of lower energy are found; (2) these low energy conformations
are found in fewer  steps; and (3) the simulations are less sensitive
to the details of the annealing protocol. To distinguish the effectiveness
of local move algorithm from the complexity of the energy function,
we have used several different energy functions. These energy
functions include the Profile score (Bowie et al., Science 253:164-170,
1991), the knowledge-based energy function used by Bowie and Eisenberg
1994 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91:4434-4440, 1994), two energy
terms developed as suggested by Sippl and coworkers (Hendlich
et al., J. Mol. Biol. 216:167-180, 1990), and AMBER (Weiner and
Kollman, J. Comp. Chem. 2:287-303, 1981). Besides these energy
functions we have used three energy functions that include knowledge
of the native structures: the RMSD from the native structure,
the distance matrix error, and an energy term based on the distance
between different residue types called DBIN. In some of these
simulations the main advantage of local moves is the reduced dependence
on the details of the annealing schedule. In other simulations,
local moves are superior to other algorithms as structures with
lower energy are found.}

contact prediction from evolutionary information can be improved
significantly if direct  and indirect information is separated.
Given sufficiently large protein families, the contact predictions
contain sufficient information to predict the structure of many
protein families. However, since the first studies contact prediction
methods have improved. Here, we ask how much the final models
are improved if improved contact predictions are used. RESULTS:
In a small benchmark of 15 proteins, we show that the TM-scores
of top-ranked models are improved by on average 33\% using PconsFold
compared with the original version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark,
we find that the quality is improved with 15-30\% when using PconsC
in comparison with earlier contact prediction methods. Further,
using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improve global
model accuracy, but  the chemistry of models generated with Rosetta
is improved. AVAILABILITY: PconsFold is a fully automated pipeline
for ab initio protein structure prediction based on evolutionary
information. PconsFold is based on PconsC contact prediction and
uses the Rosetta folding protocol. Due to its modularity,  the

Early it was assumed that de novo creation should be extremely

be  lineage-specific. Today, with thousands of completely sequenced

the creation of novel genes, a continuous process where most de
novo genes are short-lived, is as frequent as gene duplications.
There exist reports with strongly indicative evidence for de novo
gene emergence in many organisms ranging from Bacteria, sometimes
generated  through bacteriophages, to humans, where orphans appear
to be overexpressed in brain and testis. In contrast, research
on protein evolution indicates that many  very distantly related

biological systems by revealing atomic structures of proteins,
nucleic acids and their complexes, with much recent interest in
very large assemblies like the ribosome. As crystals of such large
assemblies often diffract weakly (resolution worse than 4 A),
we need methods that work at such low resolution. In macromolecular
assemblies, some of the components may be known at high resolution,
whereas others are unknown: current refinement methods fail as
they require a high-resolution starting structure for the entire
complex. Determining the structure of such complexes, which are
often of key biological importance, should be possible in principle
as  the number of independent diffraction intensities at a resolution
better than 5 A generally exceeds the number of degrees of freedom.
Here we introduce a method that adds specific information from
known homologous structures but allows global and local deformations
of these homology models. Our approach uses the observation that
local protein structure tends to be conserved as sequence and
function evolve. Cross-validation with R(free) (the free R-factor)
determines the optimum deformation and influence of the homology
model. For test cases at 3.5-5  A resolution with known structures
at high resolution, our method gives significant improvements
over conventional refinement in the model as monitored by coordinate
accuracy, the definition of secondary structure and the quality
of  electron density maps. For re-refinements of a representative
set of 19 low-resolution crystal structures from the Protein Data
Bank, we find similar improvements. Thus, a structure derived
from low-resolution diffraction data can  have quality similar
to a high-resolution structure. Our method is applicable to  the
study of weakly diffracting crystals using X-ray micro-diffraction
as well as data from new X-ray light sources. Use of homology
information is not restricted  to X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron

de novo 3D structure prediction of globular and alpha-helical
membrane proteins from sequence alignments alone, we developed
an approach to predict the 3D structure of TMBs. The approach
combines the maximum-entropy evolutionary coupling method for
predicting residue contacts (EVfold) with a machine-learning approach
(boctopus2) for predicting beta-strands in the barrel. In a blinded
test for 19 TMB proteins  of known structure that have a sufficient
number of diverse homologous sequences  available, this combined
method (EVfold_bb) predicts hydrogen-bonded residue pairs between
adjacent beta-strands at an accuracy of approximately 70\%. This
accuracy is sufficient for the generation of all-atom 3D models.
In the transmembrane barrel region, the average 3D structure accuracy
[template-modeling (TM) score] of top-ranked models is 0.54 (ranging
from 0.36 to 0.85), with a higher (44\%) number of residue pairs
in correct strand-strand registration than in earlier methods
(18\%). Although the nonbarrel regions are predicted less accurately
overall, the evolutionary couplings identify some highly constrained
loop residues and, for FecA protein, the barrel including the
structure of a plug domain can be accurately modeled (TM score
= 0.68). Lower prediction accuracy tends to be associated with
insufficient sequence information and we therefore expect increasing
numbers of beta-barrel families to become accessible to accurate
3D structure prediction as the number of available sequences increases.}

(2) derivation of sequence preferences for 2 up to 29 contact
interface types, (3) generation of numerous hypothetical model
structures by placing the input sequence into a large set of known
three-dimensional structures in all possible alignments, (4) evaluation
of these models by summing the sequence preferences over all structural
positions and (5) choice of predicted three-dimensional structure
as that with the best sequence-structure fitness. Evolutionary
information is incorporated by using position-dependent core weights
derived from multiple sequence alignments. A number of tests of
the method are performed: (1)  evaluation of cyclic shifts of
a sequence in its native structure; (2) alignment  of a sequence
in its native structure, allowing gaps; (3) alignment search with
a sequence or sequence fragment in a database of structures; and
(4) alignment search with a structure in a database of sequences.
The main results are: (1) a native sequence can very well find
its native structure among a large number of alternatives, in
correct alignment; (2) substructures, such as (beta alpha)n units,
can be detected in spite of very low sequence similarity; (3)
remote homologous can be detected, with some dependence on the
set of parameters used; (4) contact interface parameters are clearly
superior to classical secondary structure parameters; (5) a simple
interface description in terms of just two states, protein-protein
and protein-water contacts, performs surprisingly well; (6) the
use of core weights considerably improves accuracy in detection
of remote homologues; (7) based on a sequence database search
with a myoglobin contact profile, the C-terminal domain of a viral
origin of replication binding protein is predicted to have an
all-helical fold. The sequence-structure fitness concept  is sufficiently
general to accommodate a large variety of protein structure prediction
methods, including new models of intermediate complexity currently
being developed.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial
and functional relationship of residues in a protein and contains
key information for protein 3D structure prediction. Although
studied extensively, it remains challenging to predict contact
map using only sequence information. Most existing methods predict
the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring correlation
among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole-contact map.
A couple of recent methods predict contact map by using mutual
information, taking into consideration contact correlation and
enforcing a sparsity restraint, but these methods demand for a
very large number of sequence homologs for the protein under consideration
and the resultant contact map may be still physically infeasible.
RESULTS: This article presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact
map prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints
by machine learning and integer linear programming. The evolutionary
restraints are much more informative than mutual information,
and the physical restraints specify more concrete relationship
among contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method
greatly reduces the solution space of the contact map matrix and,
thus, significantly improves prediction accuracy. Experimental
results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms currently popular methods
no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein
under consideration. AVAILABILITY: \verb+http://raptorx.uchicago.edu+.}

of their three-dimensional structure and their biological function,
leading to strong evolutionary constraints on the sequence variability

constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby
at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information
alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling
analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved
a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been
successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein
structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature
of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires
exponential time in the protein length, and efficient approximations
are needed for practical applicability. Here we propose a very
efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach as a variant
of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid variables
are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The resulting
statistical inference problem is efficiently and  exactly solvable.
We show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior
to the one achieved by mean-field approximations to inference
with discrete variables, as done by direct-coupling analysis.
This is true for (i) the prediction of residue-residue contacts
in proteins, and (ii) the identification of protein-protein interaction
partner in bacterial signal transduction. An implementation of
our multivariate Gaussian approach is available at the website

important conformational  changes on interaction. The polypeptide-cross-linking

capture the translocation substrate in a 'clamp'. Polypeptide
movement through the SecY channel could be achieved by the motion
of a 'two-helix finger' of SecA inside the cytoplasmic funnel

a standard method in structural biology today. In this process
an alignment of a target protein sequence onto the structure of
a template(s) is used as input to a program that constructs a
3D model. It has been shown that the most important factor in
this process is the correctness of the alignment and the choice
of the best template structure(s), while it is generally believed
that there are no major differences  between the best modeling
programs. Therefore, a large number of studies to benchmark the
alignment qualities and the selection process have been performed.
However, to our knowledge no large-scale benchmark has been performed
to evaluate the programs used to transform the alignment to a
3D model. In this study, a benchmark of six different homology
modeling programs- Modeller, SegMod/ENCAD, SWISS-MODEL, 3D-JIGSAW,
nest, and Builder-is presented. The performance of these  programs
is evaluated using physiochemical correctness and structural similarity
to the correct structure. From our analysis it can be concluded
that no single modeling program outperform the others in all tests.
However, it is quite clear that three modeling programs, Modeller,
nest, and SegMod/ ENCAD, perform better than the others. Interestingly,
the fastest and oldest modeling program, SegMod/  ENCAD, performs
very well, although it was written more than 10 years ago and
has not undergone any development since. It can also be observed
that none of the homology modeling programs builds side chains
as well as a specialized program (SCWRL), and therefore there
should be room for improvement.}

test under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance
as well as robust methods based on the MERT statistic, the MAX
statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX

on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational

were employed in a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis setting
using summary data with weights equal to the reciprocal of the

with several newly developed features that improve its performance.
The inclusion of a properly defined end state allows for better
modeling of the beta-barrel domain, while different emission probabilities
for the adjacent residues in strands are used to incorporate knowledge
concerning the asymmetric amino acid distribution occurring there.
Furthermore, the training was performed using newly developed
algorithms in order to optimize the labels of the training sequences.
Moreover, the method is retrained on a larger, non-redundant  dataset
which includes recently solved structures, and a newly developed
decoding method was added to the already available options. Finally,
the method now allows the incorporation of evolutionary information
in the form of multiple sequence alignments. RESULTS: The results
of a strict cross-validation procedure show that PRED-TMBB2 with
homology information performs significantly better compared to
other available prediction methods. It yields 76\% in correct
topology predictions and outperforms the best available predictor
by 7\%, with an overall SOV of 0.9. Regarding detection of beta-barrel

many methods still fail to distinguish marginally hydrophobic
transmembrane (TM) helices and equally hydrophobic regions in
soluble protein domains. In vivo, this problem is most likely
avoided by targeting of the TM-proteins, so that non-TM proteins
never see the translocon. Proteins are targeted to the translocon
by an N-terminal signal peptide. The targeting is also aided by
the fact that the N-terminal helix is more hydrophobic than other
TM-helices. In addition, we also recently found that the C-terminal
helix is more hydrophobic than central helices. This information
has not been used in earlier topology predictors. RESULTS: Here,
we use the fact that the N- and C-terminal helices are more hydrophobic
to develop a new version of the first-principle-based topology
predictor, SCAMPI. The new predictor has two main  advantages;
first, it can be used to efficiently separate membrane and non-membrane
proteins directly without the use of an extra prefilter, and second
it shows improved performance for predicting the topology of membrane

less correct models is of the greatest importance for protein
structure prediction methods. Several studies have examined the
ability of different types of energy function to detect the native,
or native-like, protein structure from a large set of decoys.
In contrast to earlier studies, we examine here the ability to
detect models that only show limited structural similarity to
the native structure. These correct models are defined by the
existence of a fragment that shows significant similarity between
this model and the native structure. It has been shown that the
existence of such fragments is useful for comparing the performance
between different fold recognition methods and that this performance
correlates well with performance in fold recognition. We have
developed ProQ, a neural-network-based method to predict the quality
of a protein model that extracts structural features, such as
frequency of atom-atom contacts, and predicts the quality of a
model, as measured either by LGscore or MaxSub. We show that ProQ
performs at least as well as other measures when identifying the
native structure and is better at the detection of correct models.
This performance is maintained over several different test sets.
ProQ can also be combined with the Pcons fold recognition predictor
(Pmodeller) to increase its performance, with the main advantage
being the elimination of a few high-scoring incorrect models.
Pmodeller was successful in CASP5 and results from the latest
LiveBench, LiveBench-6, indicating that Pmodeller has a higher
specificity than Pcons alone.}

 rapidity. However,  its evolution is constrained by interactions
 between mutations in its fitness landscape. Here we show that
 an Ising model describing these interactions, inferred from sequence
 data obtained prior to the use of antiretroviral drugs, can be
 used to identify clinically significant sites of resistance mutations.
 Successful predictions of the resistance sites indicate progress
 in the development of successful models of real viral evolution
 at the single residue level and suggest that our approach may
 be applied to help design new therapies that are less prone to

common bacterial infections in humans and this infection can lead
to gastric ulcers and gastric cancer. H. pylori is one of the
most genetically variable human pathogens and the ability of the
bacterium to bind to the host epithelium as well as the presence
of different virulence factors and genetic variants within these
genes have been  associated with disease severity. Nicaragua has
particularly high gastric cancer  incidence and we therefore studied
Nicaraguan clinical H. pylori isolates for factors that could
contribute to cancer risk. METHODS: The complete genomes of fifty-two
Nicaraguan H. pylori isolates were sequenced and assembled de
novo, and phylogenetic and virulence factor analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The Nicaraguan isolates showed phylogenetic relationship
with West African isolates in whole-genome sequence comparisons
and with Western and urban South- and Central American isolates
using MLSA (Multi-locus sequence analysis). A majority, 77 \%
of the isolates carried the cancer-associated virulence gene cagA
and also the s1/i1/m1 vacuolating cytotoxin, vacA allele combination,
which is linked to increased severity of disease. Specifically,
we also found that Nicaraguan isolates have a blood group-binding
adhesin (BabA) variant highly similar to previously reported BabA
sequences from Latin America, including from isolates belonging
to other phylogenetic groups. These BabA sequences were found
to be under positive selection at several amino acid positions
that differed from the global collection of isolates. CONCLUSION:
The discovery of a Latin American BabA variant, independent of
overall phylogenetic background, suggests hitherto unknown host
or environmental factors within the Latin American population
giving H. pylori isolates carrying this adhesin variant a selective
advantage, which could affect pathogenesis and risk for sequelae
through specific adherence properties.}

 more than half of the human population; in a subset of this population,
 its presence is associated  with development of severe disease,
 such as gastric cancer. Genomic analysis of several strains has
 revealed an extensive H. pylori pan-genome, likely to grow as
 more genomes are sampled. Here we describe the draft genome sequence
 (63 contigs; 26x mean coverage) of H. pylori strain B45, isolated
 from a patient with gastric  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
 (MALT) lymphoma. The major finding was a 24.6-kb prophage integrated
 in the bacterial genome. The prophage shares most of  its genes
 (22/27) with prophage region II of Helicobacter acinonychis strain
 Sheeba. After UV treatment of liquid cultures, circular DNA carrying
 the prophage integrase gene could be detected, and intracellular
 tailed phage-like particles were observed in H. pylori cells by
 transmission electron microscopy, indicating  that phage production
 can be induced from the prophage. PCR amplification and sequencing
 of the integrase gene from 341 H. pylori strains from different
 geographic regions revealed a high prevalence of the prophage
 (21.4\%). Phylogenetic reconstruction showed four distinct clusters
 in the integrase gene,  three of which tended to be specific for
 geographic regions. Our study implies that phages may play important
 roles in the ecology and evolution of H. pylori. IMPORTANCE: Helicobacter
 pylori chronically infects the gastric mucosa in more than half
 of the human population, and while most of the infected individuals
 do  not develop disease, H. pylori infection doubles the risk
 of developing gastric cancer. An abundance and diversity of viruses
 (phages) infect microbial populations in most environments and
 are important mediators of microbial diversity. Our finding of
 a 24.6-kb prophage integrated inside an H. pylori genome and the
 observation of circular integrase gene-containing DNA and phage-like
 particles inside cells upon UV treatment demonstrate that we have
 discovered a viable H. pylori phage. The additional finding of
 integrase genes in a large proportion of screened isolates of
 diverse geographic origins indicates that the prevalence of prophages
 may have been underestimated in H. pylori. Since phages are important
 drivers of microbial evolution, the discovery should be important
 for understanding and predicting genetic diversity in H. pylori.}

One such organism is the stomach dwelling bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which is highly prevalent in Latin America where it is a major current public health challenge because of its strong association with gastric cancer. By analyzing the genome sequence of H. pylori isolated in North, Central and South America, we found evidence for admixture between H. pylori of European and African origin throughout the Americas, without substantial input from pre-Columbian (hspAmerind) bacteria. In the US, strains of African and European origin have remained genetically distinct, while in Colombia and Nicaragua, bottlenecks and rampant genetic exchange amongst isolates have led to the formation of national gene pools. We found four outer membrane proteins with atypical levels of Asian ancestry in American strains, including the adhesion factor alpB, suggesting a role for the ethnic makeup of hosts in the colonization of incoming strains. Our results show that new H. pylori subpopulations can rapidly arise, spread and adapt during times of demographic flux, and suggest that differences in transmission ecology between high and low prevalence areas may substantially affect the composition of bacterial populations.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein contacts contain key information for the understanding
of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction
from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress
has been made on this problem, but  the predicted contacts for
proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality
and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. METHOD:
This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts
by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation
information through an  ultra-deep neural network formed by two
deep residual neural networks. The first  residual network conducts
a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation  of sequential
features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional
convolutional transformation of pairwise information including
output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise
potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can accurately
model contact occurrence patterns and complex sequence-structure
relationship and thus, obtain higher-quality contact prediction
regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins
in question. RESULTS: Our method greatly outperforms existing
methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding.
Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and
398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction
accuracy obtained by our method, one representative EC method
CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30,
respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our
method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively.
Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but
without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6)
for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV-
and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of
them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much
better quality than template-based models especially for membrane
proteins. The 3D models built  from our contact prediction have
TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those
from homology modeling have TMscore>0.5 for only 10 of them. Further,
even if trained mostly by soluble proteins, our deep learning
method works very well on membrane proteins. In the recent blind
CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this
method successfully folded 6 targets with a new fold and only
0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one beta protein
of 182 residues, one alpha+beta protein of 125 residues, one alpha
protein of 140 residues, one alpha protein of 217 residues, one
alpha/beta  of 260 residues and one alpha protein of 462 residues.
Our method also achieved the highest F1 score on free-modeling
targets in the latest CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction),
although it was not fully implemented back then. AVAILABILITY:

the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage
predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately
predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly
assigning the donor and acceptor residues. RESULTS: Using the
original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV
achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range
contacts-around 60\% higher than PSICOV, and around 40\% better
than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD,
MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median
of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range
hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for
the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline
MetaPSICOV. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MetaPSICOV is available
as a freely available web server at \verb+http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/MetaPSICOV.+
Raw data (predicted contact lists and 3D models) and source code
can be downloaded from \verb+http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/MetaPSICOV.+
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at

we developed a machine-learning technique that scores how strongly
genetic variants affect RNA splicing, whose alteration contributes
to many diseases. Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic
variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant
splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than  30 nucleotides
from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common
variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the
least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others
to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing
mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular
atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using
whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed  misspliced
genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides
evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries
in precision medicine.}

Here we show that a precise mathematical analogy can be drawn between certain evolutionary and thermodynamic systems, allowing application of the powerful machinery of statistical physics to analysis of a family of evolutionary models. Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift.},

  abstract={We consider the problem of estimating the principal components of a population covariance matrix from a limited number of measurement data. Using a combination of random matrix and information-theoretic tools, we show that all the eigenmodes of the sample correlation matrices are informative, and not only the top ones. We show how this information can be exploited when prior information about the principal component, such as whether it is localized or not, is available by mapping the estimation problem onto the search for the ground state of a spin-glassâlike effective Hamiltonian encoding the prior. Results are illustrated numerically on the spiked covariance model.}

abstract ={Recently developed methods have shown considerable promise in predicting residueâresidue contacts in protein 3D structures using evolutionary covariance information. However, these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation, and the larger the protein family, the more likely that contact information is unnecessary because a reasonable model can be built based on the structure of a homolog. Here we describe a method that integrates sequence coevolution and structural context information using a pseudolikelihood approach, allowing more accurate contact predictions from fewer homologous sequences. We rigorously assess the utility of predicted contacts for protein structure prediction using large and representative sequence and structure databases from recent structure prediction experiments. We find that contact predictions are likely to be accurate when the number of aligned sequences (with sequence redundancy reduced to 90\%) is greater than five times the length of the protein, and that accurate predictions are likely to be useful for structure modeling if the aligned sequences are more similar to the protein of interest than to the closest homolog of known structure. These conditions are currently met by 422 of the protein families collected in the Pfam database.},

 abstract = {Proteinâprotein interactions are fundamental to many biological processes. Experimental screens have identified tens of thousands of interactions, and structural biology has provided detailed functional insight for select 3D protein complexes. An alternative rich source of information about protein interactions is the evolutionary sequence record. Building on earlier work, we show that analysis of correlated evolutionary sequence changes across proteins identifies residues that are close in space with sufficient accuracy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein complexes. We evaluate prediction performance in blinded tests on 76 complexes of known 3D structure, predict proteinâprotein contacts in 32 complexes of unknown structure, and demonstrate how evolutionary couplings can be used to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs in a large complex. With the current growth of sequences, we expect that the method can be generalized to genome-wide elucidation of proteinâprotein interaction networks and used for interaction predictions at residue resolution.},

  abstract={We consider a one-step replica symmetry breaking description of the EdwardsâAnderson spin glass model in 2D. The ingredients of this description are a Kikuchi approximation to the free energy and a second-level statistical model built on the extremal points of the Kikuchi approximation, which are also fixed points of a generalized belief propagation (GBP) scheme. We show that a generalized free energy can be constructed where these extremal points are exponentially weighted by their Kikuchi free energy and a Parisi parameter y , and that the Kikuchi approximation of this generalized free energy leads to second-level, one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB), GBP equations. We then proceed analogously to the Bethe approximation case for tree-like graphs, where it has been shown that 1RSB belief propagation equations admit a survey propagation solution. We discuss when and how the one-step-replica symmetry breaking GBP equations that we obtain also allow a simpler class of solutions which can be interpreted as a class of generalized survey propagation equations for the single instance graph case.}

In these cases of resistance (for example, resistance to rifampicin), numerous single amino acid substitutions may provide large decreases in the affinity of the target for the antibiotic, leading to clinically significant levels of resistance. Resistance due to target alterations should occur much more slowly for those antibiotics (penicillin, for example) that inactivate multiple targets irreversibly by acting as close analogs of substrate. Resistance to penicillin because of target changes has emerged, by unexpected mechanisms, only in a limited number of species. However, inactivating enzymes commonly provide resistance to antibiotics that, like penicillin, are derived from natural products, although such enzymes have not been found for synthetic antibiotics. Thus, the ideal antibiotic would be produced by rational design, rather than by the modification of a natural product.},

and Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometry (CLMS) data, measured on an
exemplary set of novel fold targets, were provided to the CASP
community of protein structure predictors. As solution-based techniques,
SAXS and CLMS can efficiently measure states of the full-length
sequence in its native solution conformation and assembly. However,
this experimental data did not substantially  improve prediction
accuracy judged by fits to crystallographic models. One issue,
beyond intrinsic limitations of the algorithms, was a disconnect
between crystal  structures and solution-based measurements. Our
analyses show that many targets had substantial percentages of
disordered regions (up to 40\%) or were multimeric  or both. Thus,
solution measurements of flexibility and assembly support variations
that may confound prediction algorithms trained on crystallographic
data and expecting globular fully-folded monomeric proteins. Here,
we consider the CLMS and SAXS data collected, the information
in these solution measurements, and the challenges in incorporating
them into computational prediction. As improvement opportunities
were only partly realized in CASP12, we provide guidance on how
data from the full-length biological unit and the solution state
can better aid prediction of the folded monomer or subunit. We
furthermore describe strategic integrations of solution measurements
with computational prediction programs with the aim of substantially
improving foundational knowledge and the accuracy of computational
algorithms for biologically-relevant  structure predictions for

is sufficient to produce accurate models of proteins as well as

a fast and improved method for protein contact predictions that
can be used for families with even 100 effective sequence members.

prediction. We have for more than a decade developed a set of
methods for this problem. We have  used various types of description
of the protein and different machine learning methodologies. However,
common to all these methods has been the target function  used
for training. The target function in ProQ describes the local
quality of a residue in a protein model. In all versions of ProQ
the target function has been  the S-score. However, other quality
estimation functions also exist, which can be divided into superposition-
and contact-based methods. The superposition-based methods, such
as S-score, are based on a rigid body superposition of a protein
model and the native structure, while the contact-based methods
compare the local environment of each residue. Here, we examine
the effects of retraining our latest predictor, ProQ3D, using
identical inputs but different target functions.  We find that
the contact-based methods are easier to predict and that predictors
trained on these measures provide some advantages when it comes
to identifying the best model. One possible reason for this is
that contact based methods are better at estimating the quality
of multi-domain targets. However, training on the S-score gives
the best correlation with the GDT_TS score, which is commonly
used in CASP to score the global model quality. To take the advantage
of both of  these features we provide an updated version of ProQ3D
that predicts local and global model quality estimates based on
different quality estimates. This article is protected by copyright.

novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting
the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods

Results: Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural
networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only
on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses
a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence
and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important
for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested
on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt
releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more
stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model

to, at the bare minimum, not cause serious harm to the organism,
meaning that they should for instance not aggregate. Therefore,
although the creation of short ORFs could be truly random, the
fixation should be subjected to some selective pressure. The selective
forces acting on orphan proteins have been elusive, and contradictory
results have been  reported. In Drosophila young proteins are
more disordered than ancient ones, while the opposite trend is
present in yeast. To the best of our knowledge no valid explanation
for this difference has been proposed. To solve this riddle we
studied structural properties and age of proteins in 187 eukaryotic
organisms. We find that, with the exception of length, there are
only small differences in the  properties between proteins of
different ages. However, when we take the GC content into account
we noted that it could explain the opposite trends observed  for
orphans in yeast (low GC) and Drosophila (high GC). GC content
is correlated  with codons coding for disorder promoting amino
acids. This leads us to propose that intrinsic disorder is not
a strong determining factor for fixation of orphan proteins. Instead
these proteins largely resemble random proteins given a particular
GC level. During evolution the properties of a protein change
faster than the GC level causing the relationship between disorder
and GC to gradually weaken.}

been (i) to create a flexible computational  framework for exploration
of new approaches to structure determination, (ii) to provide
tools for structure solution of difficult or large structures,
(iii) to develop models for analyzing structural and dynamical
properties of macromolecules and (iv) to integrate all sources
of information into all stages of the structure determination
process. Version 1.2 includes an improved model for the treatment
of disordered solvent for crystallographic refinement that employs
a combined grid search and least-squares optimization of the bulk
solvent model parameters. The method is more robust than previous
implementations, especially at lower resolution, generally resulting
in lower R values. Other advances include the ability to apply
thermal factor sharpening to electron density maps. Consistent
with the modular design of CNS, these additions and changes were
implemented in the high-level computing language of CNS.}

	abstract = {Some protein design tasks cannot be modeled by the traditional
single state design strategy of finding a sequence that is optimal
for a single fixed backbone. Such cases require multistate design,
where a single sequence is threaded onto multiple backbones (states)
and evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses on each backbone.
For example, to design a protein that can switch between two specific
conformations, it is necessary to to find a sequence that is compatible
with both backbone conformations. We present in this paper a generic
implementation of multistate design that is suited for a wide
range of protein design tasks and demonstrate in silico its capabilities
at two design tasks: one  of redesigning an obligate homodimer
into an obligate heterodimer such that the new monomers would
not homodimerize, and one of redesigning a promiscuous interface
to bind to only a single partner and to no longer bind the rest
of its  partners. Both tasks contained negative design in that
multistate design was asked to find sequences that would produce
high energies for several of the states being modeled. Success
at negative design was assessed by computationally  redocking
the undesired protein-pair interactions; we found that multistate
design's accuracy improved as the diversity of conformations for
the undesired protein-pair interactions increased. The paper concludes
with a discussion of the pitfalls of negative design, which has
proven considerably more challenging than  positive design.}

three-dimensional models and consequently to predict protein folds
from scratch. A considerable amount of effort is currently being
spent to improve contact prediction accuracy, whereas few methods
are available to construct protein tertiary structures from predicted
contacts. Here, we present an ab initio protein folding method
to build three-dimensional models using predicted contacts and
secondary structures. Our method first translates contacts and
secondary structures into distance, dihedral angle, and hydrogen
bond restraints according to a set of new conversion rules, and
then provides these restraints as input for a distance geometry
algorithm to  build tertiary structure models. The initially reconstructed
models are used to regenerate a set of physically realistic contact
restraints and detect secondary  structure patterns, which are
then used to reconstruct final structural models. This unique
two-stage modeling approach of integrating contacts and secondary
structures improves the quality and accuracy of structural models
and in particular generates better beta-sheets than other algorithms.
We validate our method on two standard benchmark datasets using
true contacts and secondary structures. Our method improves TM-score
of reconstructed protein models by 45\% and 42\% over the existing
method on the two datasets, respectively. On the dataset for benchmarking
reconstructions methods with predicted contacts and secondary
structures, the average TM-score of best models reconstructed
by our method is 0.59, 5.5\% higher than the existing method.

        abstract = {Understanding the evolution of a protein, including both close
and distant relationships, often reveals insight into its structure
and function. Fast and easy access to such up-to-date information
facilitates research. We have developed a hierarchical evolutionary
classification of all proteins with experimentally determined
spatial structures, and presented it as an interactive  and updatable
online database. ECOD (Evolutionary Classification of protein
Domains) is distinct from other structural classifications in
that it groups domains primarily by evolutionary relationships
(homology), rather than topology  (or "fold"). This distinction
highlights cases of homology between domains of differing topology
to aid in understanding of protein structure evolution. ECOD uniquely
emphasizes distantly related homologs that are difficult to detect,
and  thus catalogs the largest number of evolutionary links among
structural domain classifications. Placing distant homologs together
underscores the ancestral similarities of these proteins and draws
attention to the most important regions  of sequence and structure,
as well as conserved functional sites. ECOD also recognizes closer
sequence-based relationships between protein domains. Currently,
approximately 100,000 protein structures are classified in ECOD
into 9,000 sequence families clustered into close to 2,000 evolutionary
groups. The classification is assisted by an automated pipeline
that quickly and consistently classifies weekly releases of PDB
structures and allows for continual updates. This synchronization
with PDB uniquely distinguishes ECOD among all protein classifications.
Finally, we present several case studies of homologous proteins
not recorded in other classifications, illustrating the potential
of how ECOD can be used to further biological and evolutionary
studies.}
