zf-C3HC4
Zinc finger, C3HC4 type (RING finger)
The C3HC4 type zinc-finger (RING finger) is a cysteine-rich domain of 40 to 60 residues that coordinates two zinc ions, and has the consensus sequence: C-X2-C-X(9-39)-C-X(1-3)-H-X(2-3)-C-X2-C-X(4-48)-C-X2-C where X is any amino acid [1]. Many proteins containing a RING finger play a key role in the ubiquitination pathway [2].
